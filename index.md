## Howdy!

I'm a multidisclinary researcher who draws from remote observation, systems engineering, and philosophy to try and make this world of ours a little bit better and more sustainable.

At the moment, I am a doctoral student at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), in the [Space Enabled Research Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/). I've bounced around a number of fields and institutions to end up here, so if you want the full history, check out [the CV page](/docs/assets/resume.pdf).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jackreid/jackreid.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
