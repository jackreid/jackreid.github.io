## Miscellaneous Visualizations

Here is a collection of miscellaneous visualizations that were too niche or small to warrant a full project page. Some of these may be developed further, but for now they live here.

### Disney World Timelapse

*November 2021*

A fun side project that I was asked to make today. This is Walt Disney World from 1972 (one year after it opened) to the present. Dark is water and built environment, bright is vegetation. Resolution improves in 1984. First time using Landsat 1-3!

Here's the visual imagery (only going back to 1984)

And here's a labeled image so you know what you are looking at. Plenty of other locations of interest of course (including the lakes!) but this was getting busy enough as is.

### Countries With Operational Spacecraft

*April 2021*

Made a little visualization of which countries had operational spacecraft in each year, for an expansive definition of "had" (e.g. ESA's spacecraft are attributed to all full member states). Almost certainly are mistakes, will revise. This was based on a combination of Gunter's Space Page, N2YO, Wikipedia, and just googling about different countries' space activities. If someone knows of a good comprehensive source by year, I am all ears.


### First Processed Satellite Image

*Circa 2018*

This was the first satellite image that I processed. It's the Grand Canyon, but I honestly don't remember what instrument or what bands I used. I'm not even sure when exactly I made it. I do remember that I used Google Earth Engine.
