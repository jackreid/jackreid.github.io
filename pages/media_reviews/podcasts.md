# Podcasts of Interest

*Last Updated 2022-06-01*

Vida is an application of the [EVDT Framework](evdt.md) to the COVID-19 pandemic. It refers both to a decision support system and an international community. a platform for collaboration between technologists to build the Vida Decision Support System, a customized online tool targeted for use by public sector officials at the city and regional level who are making policies regarding public health, the economy, or environmental management. The Vida Decision Support System helps city and regional leaders understand the relationships between important societal factors that are changing by creating models in the following areas: Public Health, Environment, Socio-economic Impacts, Public Sector Decision Making, and Disease Surveillance Technology Design.

The international community includes the Space Enabled research group; other US-based innovators from East Carolina University, Blue Raster LLC, and elsewhere; and international based leaders and experts from the Gabinete de Gestão do Programa Espacial Nacional in Angola, the Instituto Pereira Passos in Brazil, the Instituto Politécnico Nacional in Mexico, Universitas Diponegoro in Indonesia, and the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología, Conocimiento e Innovación in Chile.
