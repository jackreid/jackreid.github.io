Obviously not all the books and audio that I consume are related to my field of study. I currently don't have any particular interest in post reviews of literally everything that I read or listen to, but I am also happy to share the list for those who are curious. Below are links to lists of books that I have read in each calendar year. Note that I adopted my current system for tracking these ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) in 2021 and have only been recording them in any fashion since late 2015. I've been able to document some books retroactively, but they should be understood to be *very* incomplete. Apologies for the weird color scheme. It's the product of the Obsidian Markdown to PDF conversion process.
