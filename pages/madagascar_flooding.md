# Impact of the 2022 tropical cyclone season on southeast Madagascar

*February 2022 to present*

In January and February of 2022, southeastern Madagascar was hit by two tropical cyclones. This prompted [Prof. Brian McAdoo](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/mcadoo) of Duke University to reach out to us about a collaboration. This is an early stage project to use a variety of data sources, including synthetic aperture radar and visual imagery, to identify areas of flooding, blocked roads, and salt-inundated farmland.
