## Miscellaneous Writings

While most of my work is focused on specific projects on Earth, I can't help but have thoughts about other topics, including our present society and our potential future in space. Sometimes these thoughts manifest in a coherent piece and are collected here.

### Move to close MIT campus to larger community contributes to the cold security of the ivory tower

*Originally published in the Cambridge Day in August 2022*

A short eulogy for the closing of MIT campus to the public. I wrote this for The Tech, only to find out that they don't really publish things during the summer. Cambridge City Councillor Burhan Azeem encouraged me to submit it to the Cambridge Day instead, who promptly published it.

### The moral equivalent of war: a new metaphor for space resource utilization

*Originally published in The Space Review in March 2022*

A short piece challenging the Frontier metaphor for space and substituting it with one inspired by William James, which has far more mixed implications.

### Student-led organizations provide robust science policy education

*Written in 2021*

This was a piece originally intended for the [Science Policy Review](https://sciencepolicyreview.org/). It was in fact requested of me and Erin Rousseau by the editors of SPR. Once we wrote it and it went through a couple of revisions, however, they felt that it was too anecdotal and too much of an argument piece, rather than a scientific paper. It never ended up finding a home despite me being quite fond of it.
