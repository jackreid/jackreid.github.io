# Podcasts of Interest

*Last Updated 2022-06-01*

Perhaps due to being raised on NPR, I am a big fan of podcasts, as they are often NPR-esque stories for a *much* more niche audience. Below are listed some of my favorite space, sustainability, and mapping podcasts. Ordering is alphabetical, not in terms of preference or anything. If you know of one I might be interested in, don't hesitate to reach out!

## The Arms Control Wonk Podcast

**Status: Ongoing**

This one isn't strictly space-related, but, like it or not, space is heavily intertwined with missiles and other kinds of weaponry. The hosts bring a pleasantly humorous approach to an oftentimes scary and depressing topic, while still keeping it quite informative. This actually helps them keep from engaging in fearmongering or hype, which is quite helpful. A major source of their information is OSINT (open source intelligence) using earth observation satellites, so it all links back together!

## Constellations

**Status: Ongoing**

This podcast is produced by [Kratos Defense](https://www.kratosdefense.com/) and is unabashedly pro-military and pro-private-business. Perhaps because of this, the host is able to interview a wide variety of big names from the space sector, be it startups, the major space companies, or military officials. If you want to stay up to date on trends in the military and commercial space sectors, it's hard to do better than this.


## Down to Earth with Terry Virts

**Status: Ongoing**

This podcast is essentially Terry Virts talking with whomever he wants about whomever he wants. Being a retired NASA astronaut and ISS Commander, though, many of his thoughts and friends are space-related. While I sometimes skip some of his episodes about other things, his deeply human interviews with scientists and executives are quite enjoyable. In particular, his ongoing tour of the solar system with Dr. James Head is informative, funny, and all the more enjoyable due to its frequent detours.

## The Evening Rocket

**Status: Concluded**

Host Jill Lepore is an excellent historian of ideas and pop culture. In this limited series, she does a deep dive into the science-fiction that Elon Musk and other space entrepreneurs loved as children and tries to understand how that influences their current worldview. When there is a lot of hero-worship and demonization of these figures going on, Lepore does an excellent job of showing how they, like all of us, are influenced by our upbringing.

## Eyes on Earth

**Status: Ongoing**

Did you know that the USGS has a podcast? And that's its really good? Eyes on Earth is a nice straightforward and enthusiastic interview series with scientists who use earth observation imagery to study how our planet is changing. The episodes are all less than 20 minutes, so they are quite digestible and a great way to learn about the general contours of the earth science field.

## Gardeners of the Galaxy

**Status: Ongoing**

This is perhaps the most wholesome podcast on this list. The host, Emma Doughty is just really into growing plants in space and wants to tell everyone about it. A mix of history, current news, and the occasional interview, Gardeners of the Galaxy is a fun way to learn about astrobotany.
