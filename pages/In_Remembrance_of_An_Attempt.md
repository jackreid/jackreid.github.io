# In Remembrance of An Attempt


## Author's Note

I struggled with writing this introduction just as I struggled in writing this book. After all, Vera Kelly needs no introduction nor does she need another biographer. Every reader already knows her name, already knows the broad strokes of her life, her adult life in particular. Whether you say her name in idolization or as a curse, that name is familiar to your tongue. How could it not be? Vera Kelly is the one who broke the world. Maybe you think what she did was justified, that the world as it was could not be allowed to stand on its deceit and sin. Maybe you think that particular sin was itself justified to protect the world that was built upon it. Your argument would be easy. All you would need to do is point to the consequences of Vera Kelly's actions.

I do not know whether we will manage to rebuild our world into something better than it was. If we do, I do not know that it will be because of her actions or despite them.

I do know that Vera Kelly tried. And I know that her story has not been told. Oh there are dozens of well researched biographies, countless news articles, and even more unfounded conspiracy theories. Her every speech has been analysed, every surviving real and claimed childhood friend interviewed, every public action scrutinized. But Vera Kelly, for all her fame and infamy, was an intensely private person. Even her genuine childhood friends said as much and what little they can offer as to her motivations and identity are muddled by the fact that the years she in which she forged her adult identity, the period in which she made her plans to reshape the world, were largely spent in lonely, fearful exile. By the time she so dramatically burst onto the public awareness, she had crafted a persona to advance her goals. This is not to accuse her of ingenuousness. She was perhaps the most genuous person I have ever known. But the fact is that Vera Kelly was a remarkably dedicated individual, one willing to sculpt her own identity to achieve her goals. 

Like so many momentous reshapers of our world throughout history, she wrote no diaries and kept her counsel close. Members of the Sodality were infamously private with outsiders, even after the organization split in two. As a result there are precious few who could tell Vera Kelly's story. These are mostly, if not entirely, those she rescued in the early years of her preparations. We came to know Vera the person before she became Vera Kelly the freedom fighter, the leader of a people, the statesperson, the most terrifying weapon the world has ever seen. We lived with her, debated with her, fought alongside her, loved her, came to know her.

Of those few who could tell the story of Vera Kelly's life, particularly the first half of her life, most, including her earliest close friend, Delilah Kayne, are dead. The one other remaining, the inheritor of her legacy, Li Xinyue, has seemingly come to view her as an unalloyed hero and thus cannot tell the story of Vera Kelly the person. 

I wrote this book because I am now an old man and I am the last one who could. And that is why I wrote it as I did, focusing on Vera's pre-public life, with only a bit post-Proclamation and practically nothing post-Warsaw. I have little interest in writing about politics and wars after a life time of trying to save us from both. And that is why I wrote it as a novel rather than biography. It is why Vera Kelly is the focus of this story and I appear only in passing. If you want the plain facts, I refer you to Francis Smith's *The Mother of Telekinesis*, Lauren Gonzalez's *Vera Kelly*, or Javier O'Keefe's *The Sundered World.* They are each admirable attempts, given the simultaneous overabundance and extreme paucity of information available to the authors. If you desire diatribe, you may consult any number of opinion pieces and political campaigns from the past several decades. 

This book is certainty faithful to the known facts: those I was present for, those that Vera Kelly related to me during our long friendship, and those that I have since gathered through conversations and research. I am helped in this regard by the fact that, to my best knowledge, Vera Kelly never once lied in her adult life. She was an inveterate practitioner of stealth and her plans often baffled her opponents, but she never lied. Not to her friends and never to her enemies. Many lives could have been saved if some of those enemies had recognized and accepted this fact. Perhaps her commitment to honesty was due to her life's quest to defeat the deceit that sent her into exile. Or maybe it was just part of who she was. I doubt that she ever gave this trait of hers all that much thought. My only concern is that perhaps the only person that Vera Kelly ever lied to was herself. 

All of that said, while this book is faithful to the known facts, it is not bound by them. I have freely extrapolated and invented events and thoughts known only to Vera Kelly. Despite this, I maintain that this is true in all its details. True to the Vera Kelly that I knew. True to the woman who, in pursuit of a better world, I followed into hell and whom I later abandoned there.

## Chapter 1 - A Rescue

*Three years before the Proclamation*

She lay prone on roof of a generic Albuquerque strip mall, quietly watching. Before her law a small parking lot, a moderately busy street, another small parking lot, and an opposing strip mall that included a local café. That café contained her target, but at the moment her focus was everywhere except that target, scanning over the parked cars, the small number of pedestrians that would brave the heat of the late afternoon sun in New Mexico, and the skies above. A pair of binoculars sat beside her, unused. She hardly needed them at this distance and besides, it wasn't like her target was hard to find. Whoever they were, they were leaking like a sieve. She couldn't *help* but know exactly where they were at any given time. Which was inside the café. 

*I can't stay up here forever,* she thought to herself. For one there was the heat. Despite the dryness of Albuquerque and her breathable clothes, she was drenched in sweat. Strip mall rooftops are not meant for human habitation. But more importantly, she was running out of time before the HDU arrived. She was doubly lucky as it was. First there was the fact that the novitiate appeared in a city that she was familiar with and, in all likelihood, probably spoke at least one language that she did. That already promised to make this a far easier operation than some she had undertaken Imagine trying to explain to someone that their entire life is about to be upended and that they need to leave *right this very instant*. Now imagine doing it in a society you have never visited and in a language that you know about as well as a babbling toddler. 

Second was the location and timing. She had been on I-25 heading north on her way to Santa Fe when she felt the telltale signal. Hadn't even reached the Kewa Pueblo. A U-turn and a short half hour drive and here she was on this rooftop. The nearest HDU unit was based out of Hollomon Air Force Base.[^1] It would take them some three-and-a-half hours to arrive, and that's if they responded immediately. She glanced at her watch. Almost 5pm. She had been for the last two hours. Longer than an ordinary customer, but then, her target was anything but ordinary. Probably having simultaneously the best and most terrifying day of their life right now. So why wasn't she barging in to offer some kind of clarity to the poor kid? In the past she didn't wait like this, hiding on a sunbaked rooftop, looking for what exactly? She would sweep in and act, often with only minutes or even seconds to spare before the HDU's arrival, relying on her quieting ability and her capacity for rapid flight if something went wrong. 

Maybe she was getting old and out of practice. After all, she had long since handed off most extraction duties to the younger recruits. She was only here by chance.

[^1]:The Hollomon AFB site never made much sense to her. Most HDU bases were located near major population centers, where novitiates were most likely to appear. Hollomon was near...what? White Sands Missile Range? She once seriously wondered if the base's proximity to Roswell meant something, but then Ezekiel had pointed out that Hollomon is hardly any closer to Roswell than Albuquerque is and Albuquerque has Edwards AFB. Oh well. So much for her solution to UFO conspiracies. Perhaps there some inane twist of bureaucratic history led to the location. The HDU might be black ops, but it was still government.

But something nagged at her. Through the cloth of her shirt, she idly rubbed the quieting pendant of woven sticks that hung around her neck, a subconscious reminder that it was there, protecting her. Several things bothered her, now that she thought about it. For one, if you suddenly discovered that you could do what any reasonable person would call "magic," would your first thought be to go get a cup of coffee? Or if you were at a café already, would you stay there? 

*Maybe they work there and found out on shift,* she thought to herself. No! Most novitiate's reaction to their awakening is somewhere between, "Holy shit, I'm fucking Harry Potter!" and absolute terror at the prospect that they are going insane. Often both at the same time. The more religiously inclined tend to throw in some panic about a good ol' demonic possession as well. Nobody reacts with, "Well I guess I better just finish off my barista shift." 

But this only concerned herself in passing. The behavior of individual, unknown humans is hard to predict, particularly when they are stressed. More important was the nature of the leakage. She hadn't noticed when she had first detected it and turned the car around, but now that she was here, something was off. Some novitiates react to their newfound powers through experimentation. These fitful bursts of untrained power are distinctive and easy to read, even from a great distance. Others desperately try to suppress their powers, only for that desperation to undue them. Visible signs of their powers like flying objects stop, sure enough, but to those who can sense such things, frantic clamping itself down shines like a beacon. True quieting requires calmness, deliberation, and some skill. And the HDU always intervenes before the novitiate has a chance to garner any skill at all. But this novitiate was different. At first inspection, it felt similarly enough to the earnest experimentation of the recently awakened, but now that she was considering it more carefully, it was different. The bursts were too consistent in strength and duration, something more akin to Morse code than haphazard flailing. 

*This isn't a novice. This is someone striving to look like a novice. Had the HDU figured out how to mimic the signals of our people? Up until now, the HDU could detect them well enough, even suppress our abilities with the right equipment. But the HDU has never managed to mimic us. Yet."

Was this a trap? She had warned her people that a more than decade of operations like this must have been noticed. The HDU were doubtlessly aware that something or someone was getting to novitiates faster than they were. They probably even suspected that she was the one responsible. And the HDU wouldn't sit idly by, would they? She willed herself to stay still. *Leaping up and panicking, won't help anyone. You survived this long, survived your own awakening, built all you have built, through caution and thoughtfulness.*  She craved to let her awareness wash out over the road, examine each person and each car, learn more about them than they knew about themselves. But if this was a trap, if the HDU really had set up shop here, such a use of her powers would be detected instantly. A suppression field would snap up and men with guns would descend upon her. No, better to rely upon her more mundane senses and the more passive receipt of this not-a-novitiate siren.


That signal had periodically moved around the café. That meant it was unlikely, though not impossible to be an HDU machine, which tended to be bulky things. Now it was moving towards the door. Would it pass by for the dozenth time or exit? She quickly snatched up the binoculars and brought them to her face. Male, white, closely shaved brown hair, clean shaven. No visible tattoos or distinguishing marks. Utterly generic. Wearing what appears to the café uniform. *So he does work there.*  He was walking a bit hunched over, nervously, with the slightest hint of a limp. He appeared to be in his mid twenties, somewhat older than the typical novitiate, but not out of the realm of plausibility. Plus, she had never been adept at guessing ages. She rarely could keep track of how old she was herself. How she longed to reach out with her mind to examine him more closely, identify if there was anything hidden under his clothes. If he was an ordinary novitiate, she would have done. Between his suspicious behavior and her lurking suspicion that this was some kind of trap, however, she thought it imprudent. But she wouldn't walk away either. Even if this was a trap, it represented a valuable intelligence opportunity. And it might very well be the case that this fake novitiate was a less than willing agent of the HDU. If so, she had a responsibility to intervene. She was going to have to improvise, and quickly.

***

Lucas was terrified. He hated that he could still feel terrified. He had thought that the years of captivity and torture had eliminated his ability to feel more than a dull dread. And one would think that finally feeling sun and wind and friendly faces, even the faces of strangers, would be a relief, a positive joy! But the certainty of the presence of watching eyes and the complete lack of certainty as to what kind of game They were playing this time poisoned that joy. 

And They hadn't just let him go either. They gave him specific instructions on what to do, how to behave, even what to wear. The lack of Walls didn't mean that he was free. In fact the lack of Walls only amplified his terror, robbed him of consistency and stability. What They hadn't given him was any explanation of why. Was this another test? If so, what was Failure here? How long would this taste of freedom, of what his life could have been, last? 

He kept his head down, his shoulders hunched forward, walking the instructed path back to the instructed apartment, trying not to jump at every passing pedestrian and car, certain each time that this was it! This was the moment that the nature of the cruel game would be revealed. They had found some new way to poke and prod him! Maybe They would throw him back in the sterile Walls he had spent these many years in. Maybe he was still there and this was all some sort of induced dream or hallucination that They had cooked up.

So enmeshed was he in building up his anticipatory fear to new heights that he didn't see the source of his dread coming. He hadn't heard the silver SUV approach him from behind, coming alongside him right as he was walking beneath an underpass. But then, all in one brief moment, he was yanked by an invisible force into the open doorway of the vehicle while every stitch of clothing on his body was violently torn asunder and left upon the sidewalk. He lay sprawled, naked and dazed on the back seat of the SUV. So used to disorientation and imperious authority over his every moment, he didn't panic. The arrival of the anticipated moment was a relief in fact. If he was returned to the Walls, at least it was a familiar hell. And if he was, finally, to die, well, it was no more than he had tried himself innumerable times. 

It was only after what felt like minutes that one of the many sense impressions of that chaotic moment surfaced into conscious thought. He had been Moved. He knew that feeling. It was unmistakable. They had never done that before! They couldn't! One of the major goals of all of the torture was to figure out how he could Move things. He had been able to pick that much up during his captivity. He had thought that only he could Move things. That it was his special curse, the source of all his suffering. But now someone else had Moved him! This realization broke his passivity and caused him to sit up with a start, making eye contact through the rearview mirror with the driver.

Before he could start babbling questions however, the driver barked out a quick, "Silence!" The part of him used to swiftly obeying commands took over. 

"I hauled you into this vehicle and tore the clothes off your back," the driver continued. "You know how I did it. Now think about what else I can do to you." His mind, having skidded to a halt at the initial command, now took off again in a frantic, circuitous race. They could Move now, if They could Move him, what did they need him for anymore? What could they do to him? Had he Failed? The only conclusion he could draw was that his life was about to get worse in a way he had not previously thought possible.

"You will not speak unless directed to. Do you speak English?" He nodded, desperately hoping that swift, complete obedience might spare him. 

"Good. There are clothes next to you. Put them on." Lucas looked around, sure enough there was a set of clothes nearby. Some nondescript jersey shorts; a plain, green T-shirt; and some sandals. He put them on awkwardly in the moving vehicle. Based on his vague recollection of normal clothes, they were all a few sizes too big but functional. At least, like the café uniform They had instructed him to wear, it was a pleasant novelty to the endless series of gowns that were his only clothing among the Walls. As he put on the clothes, he sneaked in some glances at the driver, looking for some sliver of explanation as to his present situation.

What he saw confused him. An older woman. Her face, the part that was visible around her large sunglasses at least, was tanned and wrinkled by the sun. Her frizzy, graying hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She wore an outdoorsman shirt with plenty of pockets on it. This is not how They usually looked. They were mostly paler with smooth skin. They tended to wear suits or labcoats. Who was this person?

"The necklace too. Put it on and tuck it under your shirt." Lucas looked around for a moment before finding the necklace he had overlooked, tucked partway between the seat cushions. *Sloppy! This is the kind of thing that results in Failure and Correction!* He hastily picked it up. It was a simple, light metal chain with a pendant made of a knotted bunch of.. sticks? Reeds? hanging from it. As he grasped the pendant, he gasped. It thrummed with Movement. He didn't think that possible. Could objects possess Movement or did someone have to put it there? He certainly had never embedded Movement in an object before. Did They know this was possible? Such wonderment only lasted a moment however, before his well ingrained training to complete instructions as quickly as possible kicked in. He clumsily managed to clasp the necklace around his neck and slipped it under his shirt. Instantly, the world quieted. Or more accurately, the Movement quieted. He didn't even realize that he had been Moving, that he had been ever since that fateful day in when he was 21. But now, that all stilled. It was genuine silence after living next to a waterfall.

"Sit still until we get somewhere safe." His captor's voice broke the silence. "Then I will ask you some questions. If you lie or withhold anything from me --" This was a pattern Lucas was used to. Answer question or perform some task in exchange for something nice like a sweet food. Fail and receive Correction. "I won't harm a hair on your head." His mind was thrown back into turmoil by this unexpected turn. A Failure without Correction? "Instead I will leave you in peace to find your own way. In all likelihood they" - *Did she mean They?* - "will track you down before too long. But who knows?" She shrugged. "Maybe you'll get lucky."

Lucas pondered this. Did this mean that she wasn't one of Them? Was that possible? Was she better? Was she worse? And if They did find him again, how would They react? He was growing increasingly certain that this - whatever this was, was not part of Their plan. But then again, hadn't They described just this possibility? Maybe this *was* part of another Test after all. Did he follow her orders or the ones They gave him? Which one was considered Failure? And what would the Correction be? 

Before he could follow that line of thought to its potential conclusion, the driver continued. "If you tell me the whole truth, "I will answer any questions you have and, if you want, enable you to live a long life of your choosing outside of Their grasp." Confident that she was, in fact talking about Them, he mentally capitalized her use of the pronoun.  "Think on your choice while I drive."

*They never offered information. What was this?* Lucas' damaged mind struggled to function with the expanding feeling in his chest. *Hope?* He hardly dared.

***

The older woman and younger man sat side by side on the grass of a small park by the river in Santa Fe. They weren't looking at each other. Instead they both faced the river. More of a creek to be honest, babble its way south. She was still but tense, like a predatory cat ready to pounce or flee, her focus directed outwards. He, meanwhile, seemed to be focused inwards. His head practically between his legs. His hands running through the grass, occasionally stopping to dig his fingers into the dirt for no apparent reason. The air was cool and dry, hardly warmed yet by the morning light. The only others present in the park were a small smattering of homeless individuals, none of them particularly close by or interested in the newcomers. Vera was hoping that the presence of the homeless would deter any casual passersby from approaching and make even a plainclothes HDU officer painfully obvious. It also would hopefully mean that no one would notice the bloodstain covering the man's right shoulder.

That didn't mean that she would lower her guard though. Her awareness blanketed the surrounding city block, about as far as she could reach without overexerting her quieting charm. She could feel the presence of each person stirring in their sleeping bags, each squirrel scurrying across the grass, each car the drove by on the nearby streets, and each occupant of those cars intent on their destination. She also watched and listened carefully. Vera always adamantly impressed upon her students the importance of not relying solely on your powers. 

"You never know when you might get caught in an HDU suppression field," she would tell them. "You never know what they might invent next. You lived two decades without your powers, most of you. Continue to hone your other senses." 

How seriously they took her warnings, she didn't know. But Vera had learned how to survive the hard way and she wasn't about to slip up now. 

That was the only reason why the two of them were sitting here now. It had been a close thing, this past night. As soon as Vera had hauled this distressed fellow into the car, her suspicions had been confirmed. While she was terrible at guessing ages based on appearance, the ability to sense and feel every inch of someone, inside and out, allowed her to cheat. This man was closer to thirty five than twenty five, well outside of the novitiate range. His awakening here and now had indeed be faked. 

The realization was swiftly followed by by horror and revulsion. That same sweep of her awareness over and through his body found evidence of countless violent interventions. This man had been stuck with needles and tubes all over, cut open, and sealed back up again time and time again. He had practically been vivisected. Vera had been hardened by her experiences but this made her want to vomit. Righteous fury blossomed up within her. It was one thing thing to know about what the HDU did, to be hounded by them every day for decades. But to see **this**. She wanted to kill them. To take them apart like they had taken this man apart, this man who had likely been a mere boy when they stole him away. It took a conscious effort to quell her rage for the time being, to steady her voice and issue instructions to a person who, for the second time in his life, found himself stolen away from everything he knew.

Her revulsion and anger did not prevent her from completing a second, more thorough examination of his body, even as she continued to drive, taking turn after turn through downtown Albuquerque. That second examination found something buried under the compounding layers of scars, deep in the man's shoulder. Something small and metallic that was emitting some kind of signal. *Well fuck.* 

At practically the same instant, she identified that not one, but three vehicles within five hundred meters that had been working together to tail them. She had been careful with using her powers, for surveillance or any other purpose, outside the vehicle to avoid tripping any nearby HDU sensors. *That horse has already left the barn,* Vera thought to herself.

The next period was a chaotic blur. It began with Vera mentally reaching out to separating layers of flesh in the man's shoulder and flinging the small tracker out the car and into the bed of a passing pickup truck. She did this so quickly that the man looked into shock at the small hole in the now shattered window next to him before he looked at his shoulder and torn T-shirt. It was when the blood started pouring out and the pain followed that he looked down and started moaning.

"Use your powers to hold that wound shut!" Normally, she would have done this herself, even generated enough heat the cauterize the wound. But she had other matters to attend to. The man to his credit, acted upon her instructions. After staring blankly at her for a moment, he took several deep breathes and acted upon the wound. The bleeding quickly stopped. She suspected this wasn't the first time he was ordered to perform such an operation on himself.

Vera turned her attention to solving the problem of the other cars. Only one had her in line of sight at the moment. The other two mislead by the tracker, were now following the decoy pickup. *That won't work for long. Surely they have radios.* But for the moment at least, she only had the one tail to deal with. She floored the acceleration and spun the car around a right turn, her awareness having already stretched out to confirm it wasn't a dead end. At the same time, she searched across the roadside for some pieces of metal or even rocks, thankfully never in short supply in Albuquerque. Her tail accelerated to catch up, realizing that they had been spotted. But just as they made the same hard right turn Vera flung the debris into the two left tires of the car, causing them to rupture and spilling the vehicle onto its side. This was a great deal more complicated and taxing than simply reaching out to crush the trachea or heart of the pursuing driver, but Vera fastidiously avoided murder, even in self-defense. She had deviated from this principle twice before, to horrifying consequences, and she had no desire to repeat that mistake.

She acted not a moment too soon, as having evidently realized that their pursuit had been noticed, a HDU suppression field went up, presumably originated from one of the still intact vehicles. In a moment, her extrasensory awareness evaporated, along with her ability to perform telekinesis. She would have to rely on her wits from here on out.

The next several hours were stressful and frantic, but less eventful. It involved more winding through the streets of Albuquerque, dipping in and out of the range of the mobile suppression field. Each time she felt her powers flood back into her, she took the opportunity for the pair to change vehicles. [^2] Eventually after some tense minutes-turned-to-hours of waiting for the HDU searchers to go off in the wrong direction, Vera was able to follow some backroads out of town and head up towards Santa Fe. 

[^2]: As a career fugitive, one of the more handy uses of Vera's powers was the ability to easily find car keys hidden inside or outside of cars. Or, if need be, simply unlocking and starting the vehicle without the key at all. It was simply a matter of manually hitting certain buttons and turning certain knobs. Older cars at least. Modern cars with their digital cryptographic security systems were becoming an increasing problem. Thankfully it takes many years for the old cars to disappear off the streets, doubly so in New Mexico.

They hadn't made it here, to this park, until practically dawn. As far as Vera could tell, the HDU had never picked up their scent again. Her captive behaved admirably throughout the process, never questioning her orders and managing to repeatedly close his wound until she was able to dedicate sufficient time and attention to perform a proper field dressing with the first aid supplies from her gray backpack that she had managed to avoid leaving behind at any point during their flight. He had lost a decent amount of blood to be sure, as was evident by his pallor, but he was alive and conscious.

*He's probably used to much worse.* She thought to herself. *At least he didn't completely shut down. Would have been a pain to haul him along myself through all that.* She took a moment to look at him properly with her own eyes. He continued to look down, studying the grass. His eyes had a haunted look to them. His skin was pale and clearly would be so even without the blood loss. The red-soaked threads surrounding the torn hole in his shirt blew gently in the morning breeze. Vera shuddered, thinking about how close she had come to ending up like him those many years ago. Her mind drifted to the countless souls that this *had* happened to and to the countless more that would suffer this feat if she and her students weren't successful.

*Enough ruminating though.* She still hadn't had an opportunity to assess his mental state and intentions though. To find out who he was. That's why, even as her attention scanned the surroundings, her awareness was also draped over this poor fellow by her side, ready to tighten into a vice-like grip if he made any sudden movements. He was a victim of a terrible crime, yes, but he could still be a threat.

"Are you ready for those questions, I mentioned?" She asked softly but firmly.

He flinched at the words suddenly breaking the morning quiet but quickly recovered himself. "Yes," he practically whispered, without lifting his eyes from the ground or ceasing his hands' endless movement across the blades of grass and through the dirt.

"Let's start out with your name."

"Lu--- Lucas. Lucas Hayward." His mouth seemed to trip over the words, like it wasn't used to make the sound of his own name. And yet Vera detected no deception in him.

"How old where you when had your awakening?"

"What?"

"When you developed your powers?"

"Oh, when I realized that I could Move things? Twenty two, I think."

"Where were you?"

"When leaving the Restaurant. I was a waiter. I lived with my parents. In Waukesha. Just outside of Milwaukee." That last was added after a pause, seemingly in response to Vera's inquiring eyebrow, though Lucas' eyes hadn't left the ground. "I was walking to the bus, kicking a Rock down the sidewalk as I went. I found myself Moving the Rock along with my thoughts, you know? Wishing for it to keep rolling and never stop." He voice strengthened with the telling and some light returned to his yes. "Just a dumb wish. Something to pass the time. But then the Rock kept going. I hadn't kicked it that hard, but it just kept going. And I could feel like tumbling and rolling down the sidewalk. Maybe I was the Rock, just rolling and rolling. The Rock must have gone some fifty feet before I realized that it was happening. It startled me. Practically jumped out of my socks. And then the Rock stopped moving." 

Vera nodded. This was a common enough awakening. "And what did you do?" 

His mouth twitched. Was that a hint of a smile? "Nothing. I was imaging things. Maybe the Rock kept rolling because of the wind or something dumb like that. I went Home." Lucas breathed. "Next day though, I woke up at Home and starting Moving other things without touching them. My alarm clock. The chair in my bedroom. I was freaking out. This was some Jedi shit. Or the Matrix or something. Was I going crazy? What the fuck was I supposed to do, man?" For the first time, Lucas turned his face to look at Vera, a pleading look, desperate for... forgiveness? She just returned the gaze, her eyes comforting, maintaining contact, but she didn't not move or answer the question. His face fell back to the ground as he continued his story.

"Anyways, I called in sick. My parents had already left for work. I just stayed in my room most of the day. I would practice Moving things for a bit, then get freaked out and just sit on the floor for a while. Then I would try Moving things once more. That afternoon, They came. I remember that suddenly I couldn't Move things anymore. Couldn't feel where stuff was without looking at it. I thought, 'Maybe this is it. It was a fluke. Something random. Now I'm back to being normal.'" A hint of wistfulness crept into this voice then. Regret too, for something lost.

*The HDU suppression field,* Vera though. *Standard operating procedure for kidnapping a novitiate.*

"But then I heard the door slam open. Bang! Steps running up the stairs. Men with masks and guns in my room. I remember my face hit the floor somehow. Then something over my head. Then nothing. Next thing I know, I woke up in the Walls."  Vera had noticed that Lucas tended to pronounce certain words as though they were capitalized. Rock. Walls. Like there was only one rock, only one set of walls. Maybe for him, that was indeed the case.

"It was like prison. No, like an insane asylum. I never saw anyone but Them. I never left the room. Not while conscious anyways. They always came to me. They would give me tests or tell me to Move things while they hooked up all sorts of medical equipment to me. I could only Move things when they wanted me to. If I tried to Move things without being told or if I tried to Move something that They didn't want me to, They gave me Correction. Sometimes they drugged me. I don't know what happened then but afterwards I would have stitches and scars and my body would feel weird. Sometimes they didn't drug me." His voice trailed off. "I... don't want to talk about that." 

Vera didn't press him. After a moment, he continued, "That's where I've been for the last ten years. I didn't know it was ten years at the time. I tried to keep track of the days. You know like prisoners to those cartoons and movies? Tallies on the Walls. But instead of the Walls, I did it on the underside of the bedframe. But I only made it to fifteen when They noticed. I got Correction for that." 

"How did you end up at the café?"

Lucas looked up at the sky. "They said that it was a new Test. They knew I had been a waiter. They brought tables and chairs and glasses and dishes into the Walls so that I could practice again. They said that I would have an apartment within walking distance of the café. That I was to show up to work everyday. Do my shift and walk home. Don't talk to anyone about myself. Don't talk to anyone at all, really, unless I had to. They gave me clothes. Real clothes. They said that They would be watching me. That if a stranger asked me to go with them, I was to obey."

*Bait for me.* Vera thought. *The question is, how willing was Lucas? How traumatized into subservience to the HDU is he now?*

Lucas closed his eyes, his face still pointed upwards. His hands clenched on the loose dirt beneath him. The muscles in his body tensed as he seemed to be weighing something of immense import.

"There's something else!" He practically spat out, his eyes remained screwed shut tight. "They said, 'If a stranger came and I went with them, once we got to wherever we were going, I was to find a phone and call a certain number and tell Them all about it and where I was. If I didn't or if I told the stranger about all this, They would give me Correction. Correction like I had never had before. Because that stranger worked for Them and They would know that I didn't follow instructions.'" Lucas leaned away from Vera, cowering from the anticipated punishment.

"Lucas," Vera said softly, waiting for him to relax. 

After several moments had passed, Lucas slowly opened his eyes, though he continued cowering. Tears were running down his face. "Did I screw up? Do you work for Them?"

Now drops of water were leaking from Vera's wrinkled eyes too. This seemed to astonish Lucas. "No," she said. "No. I'm here to take you away from Them."

Lucas broke into sobs and threw himself onto Vera's lap. This startled her and she barely checked herself from flinging him away with her power. Instead, after a moment's hesitation, she lowered her arms around him and let herself cry freely too.

***

After both Vera and Lucas had spent themselves with tears, Lucas sat back up. He used his left, unbloodied sleeve to wipe his face. Having recovered himself, he seemed embarrassed, unwilling to meet Vera's eyes. 

"What now?" he asked, his eyes on the grass once more.

"First, a new shirt for you. Then I have somewhere safe to go. Where there are more people like us."  

Lucas' eyes widened. He had wondered, hoped even, but to have it confirmed! 

"But first," Vera continued. "Do you have any questions for me?"

Lucas' mouth opened. Then it closed again. This repeated several times. He seemed paralyzed by the choice. Finally he turned to look Vera in the face again. This time when their eyes met, Vera smiled at him. Lucas hesitantly returned the smile, a bit awkwardly as he tried out the expression for the first time in years. "I want to know everything," he said.

## Chapter 2 - An Awakening

*Forty four years before the Proclamation*

Vera's own awakening had occurred some forty years prior. On a sunny but cool late September morning in Boston, Vera has working on one of the first homework assignments of her junior year at college. Or trying to. Her gaze kept sliding off the page in front of her and out her bedroom window to the sunny day outside. The chestnut tree in the front yard of the student co-op showed just the barest hint of the glorious fall plummage that was to come, but that was enough to have Vera mentally sketching out hiking trips with her friends in New Hampshire and Vermont. Growing up in southern New Mexico meant that New England's fall foliage was a lovely novelty to her, even after two years.

This particular instance of daydreaming did not represent a general tendency on Vera's part. She was a grounded and diligent student when it suited her, always scoring quite well in the classes that mattered to her. Instead this was indicative of how her priorities differed from most of her peers. She was a political science major at a predominantly engineering school. Perhaps even more heretically, she was predominantly interested in the qualitative, historical, and small scale part of her field, sometimes wandering into outright political philosophy or anthropology rather than sticking to the quantitative analysis of nations and economies that most of the faculty here pursued. Even in a school of oddballs and eccentrics, Vera didn't exactly fit in.

None of this prevented her from spending the past summer working as a research assistant for one of the polisci professors (or more accurately, for one of his grad students) on a highly quantitative analysis of the relationship between economic instability and political instability in modern nation-states. While not Vera's ideal topic, she did enjoy the work more than she expected, particularly considering that it mostly consisted of entering data into spreadsheets. The grad student was quiet, studious fellow, but was more than happy to explain each aspect of the study to Vera, including its motivations and potential findings. She appreciated that he had been willing to spend so much time teaching an undergrad like her. And the experience was informative. It had her mentally refining the more self-directed, small community-scale work that she hoped to do when she became a grad student herself in a couple of years.

She was also thankful that the summer job had led her to the house that she was currently sitting in. The student co-op occupied a large, late 19th century building in a quiet neighborhood near campus. Its residents consisted of approximately twenty-five students during the semester, though this ballooned up to nearly forty during the summer, with multiple people crammed into almost every bedroom, as students like Vera sought cheap summer rent while the dorms were closed.

The co-op was a cheerful mix of hippies and engineers (many of the residents identifying as both), constantly repainting, rearranging, and "improving" the house that they had occupied for half a century now. Most of the summer influx returned to the dorms when the school year began anew. Vera herself expected to do so when she first moved in. Those that chose to stay commonly did so because they had fallen in love with some combination of its crunchy granola culture, its daily communal dinners (whose quality far exceeded the cooking ability of the average undergrad), or some particular individual there. While Vera was not immune to the charms of any of these, what captivated her heart (and mind) was the community's system of decision-making, which eschewed standard voting or elected representatives in favor of a process of extended discussions and expressions of preferences that sought unanimous consensus. This included topics as minor as which kind of cheese the house should keep in stock and as major as which residents were assigned to which bedrooms. This form of community decision-making delighted and intrigued Vera. She longed to fully understand just why this system worked and under what circumstances it might fail.

Vera had a talent for listening to others and a quiet maturity that had attracted her dormmates and now, her fellow co-op residents. She quickly became known as the person to go when you had any kind of problem, be it a bad breakup, an overwhelming workload, an existential crisis, or a fraught parental relationship. Only the last of these did she have any personal experience with. Nonetheless, she would listen intently, asking targeted questions that struck at the heart of the problem. Then she would issue her advice, typically in the form of clear, concrete steps. This advice, coupled with her demeanor of calm coolness made her seem like a trusted authority figure, but without the potential for judgment than an actual authority might inflict. Her affect did mean that if you were looking for a shoulder to cry on, rather than advice, Vera had little comfort to give. She recognized this about herself however, and, if after a few questions she determined that what her supplicant needed was a warm hug, she quickly identified a more suitable provider of such comfort, and would walk her distraught peer over to them.

Now Vera planned on turning her listening ability to understanding this house. So when the summer ended, Vera had remained, shifting from one bedroom to another in the now (relatively) less populated house. Vera still had a roommate, though Delilah was currently attending some morning class, leaving Vera to enjoy the quiet morning on her own, idly twirling her pencil and staring out the window.

Her trance was broken when she fumbled the pencil. It bounced merrily across her fingers as she sought clumsily to recover the fluttering piece of wood and graphite. After a second or two, the pencil tired of the game and made its escape, leaping towards the floor. Vera lunged after it, her arm extended, mentally trying to arrest its fall. To her astonishment, the pencil did precisely that. Then it reversed, rising into her open hand. Instinctively her fingers closed around it. It happened so suddenly, so nonchalantly, that is might not have happened at all. Vera remained frozen, bent over and arm outstretched, staring dumbly at her hand and its tightly clutched prize.

Slowly, without taking her eyes from the pencil, she sat upright and drew in her hand. She examined the pencil more carefully. Perfectly ordinary. A yellow #2 pencil. It would need sharpening soon and the eraser was slightly worn. Its design had hardly changed in more than a century. Vera rolled it in her fingers, feeling the hexagonal shape with more attention than she ever had before. Nothing unusual. She gingerly placed the all-too mundane object on the desk before her. Still nothing. She leaned her face in close and watched for many seconds. Was it a fluke? With great care, she raised her right hand over the innocuous object of her fascination. She opened her hand, palm down. *Leap,* she willed. *Do it again. Leap!*

The pencil obeyed, rising swiftly as if thrown into her waiting hand. It happened so quickly, so without warning, that Vera failed to close her hand in time to catch it. The pencil smacked against her palm and then clattered back to the desk, Vera's belatedly closed hand gripping nothing.

***

It was here that Vera's awakening diverged from that of Lucas. Where Lucas was swiftly apprehended by the HDU, Vera would remain free, though relentless hunted, for decades to come. The difference in their fates was determined by the coincidence of two factors.

First, when faced with a genuine crisis, Vera becomes focused and calm. Disturbingly calm, in fact, according to friends who had witnessed this phenomenon. Once, as a teenager, Vera was in a car full of laughing, babbling friends when the young driver, distracted by all frivolity, accidentally ran a red light at speed, narrowly avoiding a major accident. The laughter was immediately replaced by screams, followed quickly by sobs and angry recriminations. 

Vera did none of these things. She firmly but calmly gave the panicking driver (also a friend of hers) a combination of clear instructions and comfort. "Turn onto that side street. Pull over. It's okay. No one is hurt. Put the car in park. Now breathe. Do you want to keep driving us or have someone else take over?" 

And once the driver had recovered, Vera informed the other passengers that the driver would resume her duties. She did this in a tone that would brook no insults and that eliminated any doubts in the drivers competency. During this entire process, including the swerving, flash of headlights, and honking, Vera's heart rate never elevated.

Her heart rate did elevate when her powers awakened. How could it not when she suddenly found herself able to perform the seemingly impossible? *Telekinesis! I can move stuff with my fucking mind!* But this excitement did not distract her from analyzing her rather novel situation as she would any other crisis. After conducting enough tests of moving objects around her bedroom to confirm that this was no transient hallucination, Vera retrieved one of her housemates and conducted a demonstration, passing it off as a mere bit of stage magic that she was working on. Eccentric hobbies were common enough at her college that this was a plausible explanation. Her housemate, dutifully impressed, was swiftly ushered out of the room with a promise of a full routine to follow.

So what was going on here?

Option 1) She was having a persistent hallucination, one consistent across all of her senses and capable of including not only newfound powers of telekinesis, but also her housemate's reactions to said newfound powers.

Option 2) She did indeed have newfound powers of telekinesis. 

Vera did not know if Option 1 was possible or what kind of brain damage it would imply. What she did know was that it was futile to go down that line of thought. What would she do about it? Go to the hospital? But what if she was hallucinating going to the hospital? Maybe she was asleep in her bed and all of this was some particularly vivid dream. Or maybe she was writhing on the floor, foaming at the mouth as her housemates looked on in horror. Such all encompassing skepticism was useless.

So Option 2 it was.

Another question shortly crossed Vera's mind. *Am I the only one who can do this? If not, why isn't this common knowledge? By all rights it should be. This is a Big Deal.* Several possibilities occurred to her:

A) She was either unique or sufficiently rare in human history to be functionally unique. Vera was leery of self-aggrandizement and so didn't consider this particularly likely. Moreover, if she was indeed unique, she could decide her next course of action at her leisure.

B) These powers periodically manifest in individuals but just as suddenly vanish, preventing them from being studied or recognized as real. If this was the case, Vera should treasure this unusual experience before being returned to normalcy, knowing that no one would ever believe her afterwards.

C) More individuals with such power exist, but they voluntarily keep it a secret. The wizard-muggle scenario. But surely someone would have let the cat out of the bag by now! Even if this was true, she could wait to make that decision herself or for some mentor figure from the wizarding world to present themselves and induct her. 

D) More individuals with such power exist, but the truth is actively suppressed. Control over the media would be insufficient, particularly in the era of the internet and the camera phone. No, someone, or a great number of someones, would need to identify individuals such as her and act quickly to silence them.

This last thought gave her pause. She didn't necessarily think that it was the most likely scenario, but it was the only one to pose a proximate threat. Thus it was the only one to demand immediate action from her.

The ability to quickly suppress those with power such as hers implies an ability to find the bearers of such power. This detection was evidently not preemptive, as Vera was still sitting here cross-legged on the floor of her and Delilah's bedroom, unmolested as she mentally rolled a lacrosse ball back and forth before her. *Why do I even own a lacrosse ball? Or is it Delilah's? But she doesn't play lacrosse either. Do we even know someone who plays lacrosse?* she briefly wondered. *Irrelevant.*

If those with powers were detectable - or maybe it was the use of such powers - there must be some characteristic signal that she was emitting. Sound? Electromagnetic? Light? Visible or otherwise? She started her investigation with her own senses. She would push the ball, varying the timing and strength, listening and watching for something, anything. She was just about to give up and see if she could scrounge up a multimeter, an oscilloscope, or maybe even a housemate's ham radio set, when she noticed something odd. 

Thinking about the ham radio aficionado, she realized that she could tell that he was in his room (though not using the ham radio at the moment). In fact. she could... feel?... all her housemates moving about the house. Now that she thought about it, she could feel stationary objects too. The bunkbed behind her. The glass of water on her desk. She could feel their location, shape, and texture, as if she was running her finger along them. So focused had she been moving objects with her mind and on her own mental state and situation, that she had failed to notice this expansion of her senses.[^3] This was marvelous! She could feel the thrum of the each window AC unit in the building, the books on the shelves, the squirrels in the attic, the branches brushing against the walls, the house cat chasing a mouse in the yard, each mouse in each warren, the worms wriggling in the dirt, the first leaves of fall fluttering to the ground, the veins and imperfections on each of those leaves, the--

[^3]: Future conversations with novitiates taught her that this is a common oversight during an awakening. Observation requires a certain stillness of mind that is typically in short supply amid the mix of excitement and terror that novitiates are experiencing.

Vera reeled back, tipping over and smacking her head on the wooden floor. The impact and subsequent pain recalled her to herself. Only then did she resume breathing, something that she had apparently stopped doing an unknown time before. 

*That was too much.* She took a moment to breathe and recenter. Then she stretched out her awareness again, gradually this time. She stopped at the walls of her room. With some effort, she maintained her awareness there while she resumed rolling the ball. She didn't notice anything different. She chose to escalate, violently shoving a chair across the room. It shrieked across the floors and then fell over with a loud thump. 

But she saw it this time. A sort of ripple echoing outwards from the point in space that she shoved the chair, only visible in her extrasensory perception. Now that she knew what she was looking for, she returned to the lacrosse ball, leaving the chair where it had fallen. After a few passes back and forth with the ball, she picked it up again. Fainter but evident. *So the strength of the signal is correlated with the strength of the force I exert. If I stop exerting this ability, am I undetectable?*

Her curiosity prompted another experiment. She stopped rolling the ball and "looked" at herself. Making sure to remember to breath, she closed her eyes and focused her mind. *There. There it is.* The same ripple was coming from her, even though she wasn't moving anything. She started expanding her awareness, moving it beyond the walls of her room, but locked fixedly on the ripple. No rodents or leaves or insects this time. Just the ripple. Focusing in this way on something specific kept her from being overwhelmed. She picked an arbitrary direction and followed the ripple out of the house, down the street, one block, and then another. It was beautiful actually. Like a harmonious chord. Maybe with some acclimatization she would be able to look at everything once more and hear a symphony rather than a cacophony. Before long she was at the edge of the river a few blocks away, but the ripple kept going. She had followed it just shy of a mile before she lost track of it. *Well that's a problem.* Vera was likely **extremely** detectable if one had the right skillset, potentially at a great distance, even if she wasn't using her powers to move objects.

This line of thought meant that, when the HDU arrived to seize her a couple of hours later, Vera was sitting at the window of her second floor bedroom in the now recovered chair, watching the street  lightly draping her awareness over the entire city block. The lacrosse ball of unknown provenance lightly levitating above her open palm. And several contingencies formulating in her brain.

***

The second factor that saved Vera's life was some combination of dumb luck on her part and incompetence on the HDU's. She was never able to find out exactly what ratio.

Something she would later learn is that the HDU had a standard operating procedure for apprehending novitiates, with only small regional variations. 

1) The HDU's global surveillance system identifies an awakening. As best as Vera could tell, the spatial resolution of this system was only a few kilometers, enough information for the HDU to deploy but not for much else.
2) The HDU deploys a response unit. This unit carries its own sensors, typically inside vans or SUVs, though Vera had also seen backpack and aircraft versions as well. These sensors enable the HDU to identify the specific location of the novitiate and, ideally, the specific individual.
3) The HDU creates a perimeter. This consists both of HDU agents and suppressors. The suppressors prevent the use of telekinetic powers in the vicinity, anywhere from 500ft to half a mile, depending on the size of the suppressor and its power source. Generally, the HDU tried to suppress approximately one square mile for a seizure, with the devices themselves hidden in vehicles, often the same ones carrying the sensors.
4) As soon as the suppressors are activated, the agents move in for the seizure. In countries were secret police disappears are common, the HDU typically does this under the colors of some government agency[^4] In places where that was less acceptable, such as a wealthy neighborhood of a major US city, the HDU tended to present the seizure as a random kidnapping. Witnesses were either killed on the spot or captured as well, to be disposed of at the HDU's convenience. Even if the novitiate was killed by accident in the process, this was considered no great loss.
5) The novitiate is bound, hooded, and gagged, then placed inside a van alongside a small suppressor unit. The HDU can then make a clean getaway. Investigations into the murder-kidnappings either fail to turn up any actionable evidence or, more often, are never adequately performed in the first place.

[^4]: As many, if not most, national governments were active collaborators of the HDU or regional equivalent, this was commonly no mere pretense. Many of the HDU agents wore two hats, spending most of their time as officers in a more conventional authoritarian police unit. 

The HDU failed to follow this procedure in Vera's case. She had noticed their arrival. Even without her powers, the street was in a quiet residential neighborhood and the sudden arrival of multiple SUVs and vans was noticeable to anyone paying a modicum of attention. 

Then the suppressors kicked in and Vera's lacrosse ball dropped to the floor, her extrasensory awareness vanishing before it hit the ground. This startled Vera immensely. She had failed to consider the possibility that whatever organization suppressed the wielders of her power had the ability to literally suppress those powers themselves. 

*Idiot! Of course they would, how else would they be able to capture people like me?* Vera was furious with herself. This oversight would lurk in the back of her mind for years to come, popping up when she was having trouble sleeping or doubting her leadership abilities. But such self-vituperation would need to wait. Vera began sprinting to the back of the house, mentally scrambling to adapt her escape plan.

But then, just as suddenly, her powers came flooding back to her. Vera would later come to suspect that the HDU had fumbled their intelligence gathering step. This neighborhood was full of century old homes, many of which had been subdivided into two to six units of a couple of bedrooms each. Vera's home, however, was a student co-op affiliated with the local university. Some thirty students occupied the building, which consisted of one unified household. Perhaps the HDU had failed to notice this before turning on the suppressors. Maybe some HDU analyst had done a search on the address and turned up the co-op's website, including descriptions of the community and photos of the interior. What they had expected to be a simple smash and grab of a single family unit was something much larger. More witnesses, more potential escape routes, the possibility of additional surveillance, and the likelihood of more questions afterwards. Maybe the HDU hadn't even figured out who specifically in the house was the novitiate. 

Having realized their error, the HDU evidently elected to turn off the suppressors to gather more intelligence. The suppressors also dampen the signal emited by novitiate, preventing the sensors from identifying them. This was a mistake that would haunt the HDU for the remaining decades of its existence.

Regardless of the specific reason, Vera found her power flowing back into her, she was on the second floor of the back deck. 

*Plan is back on. No telling how long this will last. Better go with the route that frontloads.* She briefly considered just leaping off the deck and using her powers to catch her, but decided against it, unsure in her level of control. She could ill afford a sprained ankle or broken leg at the moment. Instead she grabbed onto the firepole that ran from the third floor deck down to the backyard. She snatched Delilah's electric scooter from the back porch (*Sorry, friend*) and sprinted to the fence separating her house from the one behind it.  

Clutching the scooter to her chest and frantically willing her escape into existence, she lifted herself up and over the fence. It was more of a savage throw than a controlled flight. She barely cleared the fence and the scooter clipped the top, almost jumping out of her hands. Vera hit the ground on the far side of the fence much harder than she expected, only barely remaining to stay upright with a clumsy stumble. Her sudden arrival surprised the three, black-masked men in her neighbors' backyard. Perhaps used to familiar to HDU's conventional, suppressors-active seizures, they hadn't expected to see a young woman come hurtling over the fence, her leap far surpassing a professional basketball player in height, if not in elegance. Before they could recover themselves, Vera was crudely shoving them with her mind, letting them experience some taste of that flight themselves. Their pistols flew from their hands, black metal glinting in the afternoon sunlight.

Vera sprinted up her neighbors' sideyard and onto the street. She swung the scooter out before her and leapt onboard, twisting the throttle to maximum acceleration, a maximum that well exceeded the manufacturer's intentions. *Thank god that Delilah's such an engineering nerd,* Vera thought to herself as she sped past the parked vans surrounded by men now shouting into radios and drawing guns. 

She had gotten a full block before the suppressors kicked back in, causing her to lose track of attackers. The last thing she felt was agents sprinting back to their vehicles and those vehicles peeling out in pursuit of her. She fully expected a bullet to pierce her back, but none came. Perhaps these thugs were unwilling to open fire in a busy neighborhood. 

She cut through a park and over some train tracks. The nearest vehicle crossing was a two minute drive away, which would buy her some precious time. Breaking through onto another street, she remounted the scooter and booked it towards campus. 

During her all-too-brief investigation into the extent of her powers, Vera had noticed that her awareness was damped by presence of significant intervening mass. She could reach out more than a mile through open air and building walls provided only minimal damping, but she couldn't perceive more than a few feet under the ground. She was hoping, praying really, that the her pursuer's sensors functioned similarly. Fortunately, Vera's university campus contained a quite large system of tunnels underneath it. These tunnels were used for additional lab space, building utilities, and as a means for students and faculty to traverse from one building to another in poor weather. Furthermore, the student body had a long tradition of illicitly navigating the non-public tunnels, as well as air ducts, plenums, and service passages. Vera was an enthusiastic participant in such activities. If she could make it campus, a mere three minutes away at the speed that she was going, she had a chance, a bare chance, of masking the beacon that was her very self. Of course, with as much manpower as they evidently had available to them, they could mount a thorough search of the tunnels or just set up a perimeter around campus and wait for her to come out. She couldn't lurk down there forever, like some *Phantom of the Opera* ghoul. Or maybe she could? Such decisions could wait until she had a spare moment to think.

***

Vera's intuition was correct. The tunnels of the university did indeed shelter her, both from pursuit and from the suppressors. As she descended the stairs and sprinted past students mildly annoyed at her rush, she felt her powers returning. She zigzagged through tunnels and doors before coming to a halt in the dark of a rarely used service shaft. She could hopefully stay here for at least a couple of hours before even an organized manhunt would find her. Vera spent those hours thinking and experimenting.

She quickly abandoned the idea of becoming a modern day Erik. At some point her pursuers would get tired of waiting and hunt her down here, if they hadn't already started their search. Besides, her vibrato was, at best, mediocre. She did, however, make an important discovery. By quieting her mind and straddling a thin line between focus and relaxation, she could still the vibrations echoing forth from her body. This *quieting*, as she started thinking of it, seemed to be near complete. At the very least, she couldn't feel the ripple anymore, no matter how hard she looked. Of course, any attempt to actively use her powers, be it to move something or even just surveillance, made the ripples resume. That said, through some effort, she could quell those resulting disturbances too, though far more imperfectly. 

This knowledge in hand, she was able to formulate a strategy. Step one was escaping from her temporary haven of concrete and earth. She climbed up the ladder, down a narrow tunnel, and opened a door, confidently stepping into the brightly lit hallways on the other side and walking like she had nothing to hide. This public underground hallway was lightly populated with scholars on their way to some class or experiment or meeting. None seemed to notice that she had just exited from an unmarked door that was usually kept locked. 

Vera slowly made her way through a series of such hallways, all the while carefully quieting herself. Replaying the hectic memory of her initial flight, she realized that she hadn't seen or felt anything on the agents surrounding her house that seemed like a sensor device. Those were all inside the vehicles. But her memory is such a situation is faulty at best and "seemed like" is an awfully tenuous clause to bet on. Besides, there was always the possibility that one or more of those agents was like her and could sense her presence without the assistance of technology. And ultimately it was her life she was gambling with here, so she would play cautiously.

She had a specific destination in mind, an underground parking garage on the north side of campus. She had never stolen a car before but had a vague idea of the steps involved. Hopefully her powers would substitute for her lack of knowledge and tools. She briefly considered stopping to use some campus computer to look up instructions,[^5] but time was not on her side. The moral implications of stealing a car hardly bothered her. While she had felt genuinely bad for shoving those masked, guntotting men so hard and genuinely hoped that they were alright, despite their bad intentions, Vera had, even at the best of times, a certain disregard for the sanctity of private property. And these were not the best of times.

[^5]: Vera's phone presumably still lay abandoned in the bushes by the entrance of the campus building that she had sprinted through. She assumed that any organization with these kind of resources might very well have the ability to engage in much more mundane methods of locating a person, so she had elected not to bring the phone with her.

Before long she turned a corner and stepped directly into the lower level of the parking garage. Her gaze swept over the concrete space, looking for threats. She didn't dare use her powers to search the garage and potentially trigger whatever sensors her pursuers had. But there was no one. Just rows of empty cars and empty spaces. More of the latter than the former, which made sense for the now late hour of the evening. 

After a moment's thought, she identified her first target: a gray sedan positioned in the corner of the garage. Fuel efficient, discrete, exactly what she needed. Vera briskly but quietly walked to the car, slipped in between the passenger door and the concrete wall, and sat down. She was virtually invisible to anyone who wasn't actively looking for her. Which people very much were unfortunately. She took a few deep breaths, closed her eyes, and consciously relaxed her shoulders. A quick, vaguely directed prayer that the concrete would be enough to hide her, and she began her work. Her awareness flowed over the car. She was confident that she could unlock the car from the inside with her powers. She was less confident she could start the engine. Even if she could, what if she later needed to start the car in a hurry while in range of whatever her pursuers had used to suppress her powers? 

A car door closed somewhere off in the distance, startling her and caused her awareness to retract in a snap. She sat still, listening careful. Nothing. She continued to wait patiently, her breathing controlled and her heart steady. A car engine started in the distance. Was it the same one? Impossible to tell amid the echoing concrete. The engine noise faded as the car moved away, presumably exiting the garage. she continued to sit as the minutes ticked by. Still nothing.

Finally, Vera was satisfied that there was no additional security to be wrung from continued patience. Her eyes closed once more and her mind reached out to study the sedan. Nothing key shaped in the glovebox or behind the sunshades. Nothing helpful in the center console or cupholders. She recalled that her parents kept a spare key to each of their cars in a small magnetic box stuck to the undercarriage. A quick check confirmed that, no, nothing was down there either. This car wouldn't do. Vera nodded to herself. She hadn't expected to get lucky on the first try.

A blue SUV was parked just on the other side of the gray sedan. Not as ideal a vehicle. *But beggars can't be choosers.* Without moving form her seated hiding position in the corner, Vera began mentally studying the SUV. Though she had little experience to base it on, Vera expected that she would need to go through at least ten cars to find one with a hidden key.

She ended up searching twelve cars and physically relocating four times before finding what she sought: a blue sedan with a spare key hidden on the undercarriage. Each search was faster than the last, Vera's proficiency rapidly increasing with practice. By car six, she no longer had to close her eyes. By car nine, Vera was confident that she would conduct a suitably thorough search while walking by without pausing, though she continued to sit and hide out of an abundance of caution. Now wasn't the time for showing off.

Despite her increasing proficiency, Vera was tiring however. A sleepless night hiding in the depths of the university tunnels and now here she was, using her newfound sense abilities while simultaneously stilling the signal that practically clamored to ring forth from her every action, including her mere existence. She was thus immensely relieved to find the spare key at last. *Time to get out of here*, she thought as she slid under the car to retrieve the key by hand. Using her power to search was one thing, but she wanted to avoid actually moving objects with her mind until she was well and truly away from her pursuers. 

The concrete was cool through her shirt. The tight space smelled like gas and oil and corrosion. Thankfully she needed only a moment, her mental senses quickly guiding her hand straight to her goal. No fumbling around in the dark like the last time she did this, retrieving the spare for her father's car. He had sent her down there at age nine despite the heat and dust of the southern New Mexico summer because "she was small and could do it faster." In retrospect, Vera thought he probably just didn't want to dirty his office clothes. *Well at least I learned where to look for spare keys,* she acknowledged to herself, though she still refused to give her father any pedagogical credit.

Vera grabbed the entire magnetic box rather than trying to open it under the car. A few moments later she was in the driver's seat and turning on the ignition. The vibration of the running engine brought a smile to her face, followed by a brief peal of laughter when she thought of how her father would react if he ever learned that something he had taught her, however unintentionally, had enabled her to commit grand theft auto.

That laughter was all too brief, however, cut short by the need to focus on the task at hand. Or was it the realization that she had no idea if  or when she would see her father again? She pushed that thought aside, reminding herself to be practical here.

Vera carefully adjusted the seat and mirrors, tested the turn signals and the windshield wipers. Three quarters of a tank and no warning diagnostics on the dash. She couldn't afford any accidents here, nothing that would draw attention to herself. Satisfied, she threw the car into reverse and backed out of the parking spot. 

The sedan handled well as she drove up the turning slopes of the garage ramps, ascending one floor after another towards the surface. Vera redoubled her efforts at quieting her signal. No extraneous thoughts were permitted. She approached the exit, prepared to make some excuse to the attendant for not having her university ID on her. But the bar raised on its own as she approached. She continued moving forward, acting unsurprised, then saw the lens of an automated license plate reader pointed at the car. Evidently it had identified this car and automatically charged the account of whatever student, staff, or professor she was stealing it from. Maybe it even saved an image of her at the wheel. *Let them wonder why I would do such a thing.*

Now was the moment of truth. The car nosed out of the garage, onto the street and into the quiet darkness of the early morning. *Madrugada, that's what the Hispanic kids in high school would have called it,* Vera thought before quickly refocusing on the task at hand. She tried to relax, physically at least, forcing herself to drive as normally, as casually as possible. *Don't force it.* Excessive caution could doom her as easily as excessive haste.

Sure enough, an unmarked white van was parked only a few dozen feet from the entrance of the garage. Tinted windows prevented her from seeing any occupants at a glance and she prevented herself from studying the vehicle more closely. She forced herself to turn the car towards the van, rather than away., to drive calmly pass as if nothing was wrong, as if nothing *could possibly* be wrong. While her breathing and heart remained steady, Vera's veins felt like ice. For all her treasured coolness under pressure, she was well and truly terrified at this moment.

But then the moment passed. The van did not react to her approach or departure. It did not turn to follow. There was no shouts or alarms or gunfire. The van just sat there, waiting for prey that had already slipped the net.

With no small effort, Vera peeled her eyes from the image of the van in her rearview mirror. *Just keep driving.* She passed two more suspicious vans and one SUV before she left the vicinity of the university. She didn't know if they belonged to her pursuers or not, but she felt the fear anyways as she passed each. And she did her best to remember their license plate numbers.

Soon enough she was away, driving through residential streets populated only by the still sleeping. Vera began zigzagging her way north through the tangle of Boston's street. She made her way towards a highway out of town.

***

Dawn found her crossing the border into New Hampshire, a tight, defiant smile on her lips. She wasn't out of the woods yet. In fact she was now about to literally enter them. But she had bested her pursuers this time. That showed it was possible. And with that proof as her standard, Vera was prepared to best them again and again, no matter how may times it took.

This moment of determined optimism would be a treasured but distant memory in the months to come.


## Chapter 3 - A Greeting

*Three years before the Proclamation*

Lucas and Vera remained in that Santa Fe park for another hour or so before being driven by their stomachs to a nearby café. Once satiated, they took to the road once more, heading northeast. All the while, Vera continued to answer Lucas' questions about his newly reclaimed life and world, only some of which had to do with telekinesis and mysterious organizations. Lucas also just wanted to learn about what he had missed during his years of captivity, only some of which Vera was able to answer, considering her own level of reclusiveness.

They were hours out of the city before it occurred to him to ask where, precisely, the pair were heading.

"Denver. To friends there. People like us," was Vera's response.

"Is that where the hideout is? The way you talked about it, it sounded, I don't know, more secluded. Rural." 

Vera chuckled, one arm resting on the car door while the other lightly gripped the steering wheel as they cruised down the highway. "No, Emancipación is south of here, in Mexico. Denver is an offshoot, a satellite location. We never know where new novitiates like you will spring up so we need to spread out. If I hadn't been passing through New Mexico, it would have been Ezekiel and Ameera who rescued you. It also behooves us to have safe houses, places we can go in case HDU ever finds Emancipación, God forbid."

Lucas pondered this for a moment and once again seemed struck with indecision as to what question to ask next. Vera waited patiently. She had gone through this process with new novitiates almost twenty times, more than the rest of the Sodality combined, though with the number of satellite locations up and running now, that would change soon. While Lucas was older and more traumatized than the previous inductees, his curiosity was no less powerful. 

Finally, he blurted something out, "Why not fly?"

"To Denver? Air travel is dangerous. Lots of security. We have fake IDs but it's best not to test them if we don't have to. Getting one for you will be a priority. Plus if something goes wrong goes wrong, we want to be able to flee without depressurizing an entire aircraft." 

Vera did not mention the other reason for driving: it allowed her to visit various casinos along the way. She didn't want Lucas's first impression of the Sodality to be using their powers to cheat at games of chance.[^14] While Vera had no compunction about stealing from casinos, so long as it was done in a prudential and distributed fashion to avoid raising any unwanted scrutiny, she was aware that many people, including some of the Sodality, viewed it was a sordid business. 

"Better casinos than cars and cash from random folks who probably can't afford it," Vera would tell her skeptics, remembering her days on the run. But best not to have that discussion with Lucas quite yet. Thankfully, the Sodality's finances were not so strained as they once were. *Xinyue might be irked at the lost funds, but she would find a way to make do. She always does.*

[^14]:Casinos were the original way for the Sodality to make money quickly, dating back to Vera's solitary days in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico. The utility of telekinesis in such environs are immediately obvious for games like roulette. While, with practice, a telekinetic can even learn to distinguish individual facedown cards, the Sodality tended to focus on games of chance, since these, due to being less susceptible to more mundane forms of exploitation like card counting, were less tightly monitored by casino security for irregularities. After the Proclamation this situation would reverse itself as casinos operators came to suspect every lucky fan of roulette of being a telekinetic.

"No," said Lucas, shaking his head and recalling Vera to the present. "Why not fly yourself, like Superman or something? I know we can. They made me do it. Sometime for Hours. In the Walls. Not high, but I know that I could do it."

Vera nodded, mentally filing away this detail about Lucas' knowledge and reminding herself that was no ordinary novitiate. He was far more advanced in some ways. In others, he was woefully deficient. She and the other teachers would have to adjust the standard curriculum, such as it was. 

"Ah, I see. We certainly can fly, and do so on occasion, when in need or when we are traveling light. But we try not to make a practice of it. The amulet on your neck isn't enough to mask something like sustained flight. You'll need to intentionally do that yourself while keeping yourself flying. That's another thing we'll teach you. It's quite taxing, particularly for long distances or if you have to carry anything with you.

"Flying is also quite conspicuous in a more mundane sense," she continued. "A human flying through the sky is a great way to attract attention. Even at night there are radar and infrared concerns. While most people would dismiss such sightings as conspiracy theory nonsense, we can bet that the HDU will be paying attention. And none of that is to mention the risk that some hunter will think you are a bird and take a shot."

Lucas seemed disappointed at this response. Of course he was. Vera restrained herself from laughing. She didn't want him to think she was being patronizing. Flying is a common escapist fantasy and no doubt it would manifest powerfully in one as confined as Lucas had been. 

She turned and offered an understanding smile. "Don't be glum. At Emancipación, we have more powerful wards set up. If you're discrete, you can do some flying there. And if we are someday successful overcoming our oppressors, maybe we will be able to fly freely wherever and whenever we like. We'll still need to keep an eye out for hunters though. I doubt that will change."

This seemed to perk Lucas up, which in turn gladdened Vera's heart. The kid deserves some joy. No, not kid. He was in his thirties. Vera would have to keep reminding herself of that. Too easy to fall into old habits of inducting novitiates.

"So what are Ezekiel and Ameera like?" Lucas had found his next question. "And how long will we stay with them?" Multiple questions. With the promise of flight on the table, Lucas was no doubt eager to get to Emancipación. 

"Just for the night," Vera replied, choosing to answer the latter question first. "We'll tell them how your rescue went so they aren't worried and then head to Emancipación tomorrow. It will be a long day of driving." She omitted the fact that she would also task Ezekiel and Ameera with gathering the diasporic telekinetics. Lucas' arrival changed things in ways that concerned Vera. There would have differing opinions on how to respond. Such discussions were best had in person. But there was no need to trouble Lucas with that yet, no need to make him think of himself as a burden.

"As for what they're like," Vera continued, "Ezekiel is a tall, skinny man. About 45 years old. Unless he's grown it out recently, he has short curly brown hair. He's extremely fair minded, loyal, and persistent. An excellent ally and a fearsome foe, I'm sure. He was actually the second person that I rescued, many years ago now. In terms of his powers, he's one of the most gifted of us."

Lucas nodded along, his eyes closed as if trying to form a mental picture of the man.

"Ameera is newer to us. Arsène found her... I guess it was three years ago now. In France. She's one of the most observant people I know and one of the quickest learners. She's also quite shy and quiet, so don't be offended if she doesn't have much to say. We sent her up to Denver only a few months back, both to get used to operating in unfamiliar environments and to learn from Ezekiel. You'll find out that sometimes the fastest way to learn how to do something with your powers is to see it being done. Part of it is learning the details through watching but a big part is just seeing that it's possible. It's a matter of will and confidence. Ezekiel has plenty of both."

Her new student sat quietly, considering all of this. Vera took the opportunity to drink some water from the bottle in the center console. This much talking was hard on her throat and reminded her of how fortunate she was to be able to share the teaching load now. She much preferred to communicate in telekinetic vibrations using the language developed by the Sodality, a language that was actively evolving and growing more complex, more natural. It hadn't been Vera's idea. What need had she for language during her years alone? Once some of the younger members of the Sodality had invented it, however, she had quickly become enamored with it. But it would be sometime before Lucas learned to speak that way.

***

The remainder of the trip continued in much the same way. They crested Raton Pass and continued north, paralleling the Front Range. The pair were still an hour out from Denver when Lucas fell asleep, his exhaustion finally overpowering his curiosity. Vera did not stir him. She was exhausted too and wanted to savor this moment of solitude before she had to face Ezekiel. Ezekiel had warned her of this. Several times  over the years, always urging more direct action against the HDU. She had heeded his concerns but hadn't endorsed them. Now her sleeping passenger was living ammunition for Ezekiel's arguments.

Vera's lips tightened as she looked out the window at the plains of central Colorado. Ezekiel was right, she had to admit. Maybe not at first, but certainly now. The Sodality was ready. Or ready to begin preparations in earnest at least. They had been, for at least three years now. That could have been three less years of captivity for Lucas. For who knows how many other Lucases still held by the HDU. Vera had delayed, not out of complacency exactly, but because she didn't see a way forward that didn't risk a great deal. She had tried force before and it hadn't worked. Now they would try again, informed by her past failure, but Vera was no more confident in their successes. At the same time, is this not what she had been preparing the Sodality for all these years?

She let out a deep sight, then glanced over at Lucas sleeping awkwardly crammed up against the passenger door. The poor boy didn't know what he was in for. If only he could have had a few years of peace after his ordeal. But no. Out of the fire and into the frying pan. Let him sleep for now.

***

Ezekiel and Ameera were sitting out on the front porch of their suburban home when Vera pulled into the driveway. As Vera threw the car into park, she felt the warm signals of a telekinetic's welcome wash over her. Lucas startled awake.

"What the fuck?!?" he cried out, looking around panically as he drew his limbs in. 

"Peace, Lucas," Vera said soothingly as she placed a hand of the shoulder of her terrified passenger. "That's just Ameera and Ezekiel saying hi. They are happy to see you for the first time."

Vera's touch seemed to break through Lucas' fear. He relaxed a bit, then still more so as he took in her words. Now he was looking around him, his adrenaline amplifying excitement rather than terror. *How long has he been without the touch of a kind hand?* Vera wondered sadly.

They unbuckled and disembarked. Their hosts had stepped down from the porch and were walking over. If they noticed Lucas' older than expected age, this fact did not cause them to hesitate. Ezekiel came barreling up, Ameera trailing behind.

"Welcome, my new brother!" Ezekiel loudly called as he wrapped Lucas in a bear hug. Lucas went rigid in the sudden embrace. Ezekiel swiftly realized his mistake and released the newcomer, backing away.

"Sorry, sorry. That was a bit forward. We can take things more slowly." Then he caught Vera's appraising eye and his enthusiasm flared back into full blaze. "Vera! It's so good to see you!" He stepped past Lucas to hug his mentor. "What kind of game are you playing? You send us up here to keep an eye out for novitiates, but then when this one comes along, you steal all the glory for yourself!"

"Hi there, E," came Vera's muffled but amused voice. "Call it a test. Got to keep you on your toes. I guess y'all just need to be quicker on the draw next time." Ezekiel guffawed at the playful ribbing. 

Meanwhile, Ameera was making a much more demure introduction. "Hi," she said quietly, a slight smile on her face. "I am Ameera" She anunciated each word distinctly, her accent a mix of French and Tunisian. This greeting seemed to be more Lucas' speed.

"Hi," he replied, equally shyly, struggling to meet Ameera's green eyes. "I... I guess I'm Lucas."

"You guess or you are?" Ezekiel asked in jest as he released Vera.

"Um..." Lucas struggled in respond, embarrassed.

"Go easy on him, E," Vera chided calmly, a hint of amusement still present in her voice. "Ameera, dear, why don't you give Lucas a tour, let him wash up and get some rest?" Ameera nodded and led Lucas inside.

Vera walked around to the trunk and opened it. Before she could grab her backpack and the couple of plastic convenience store bags, Ezekiel ducked in next to her and gathered them all up. He shouldered them just a bit easier than should have been possible. Such casual use of his powers on a public street concerned Vera a bit, even if the effect was subtle. 

"I got it," he said. Then slipping into the language of telekinetics he mentally whispered, "So what the hell happened yesterday? There's no way he just awakened!"

"He awakened years ago. In Wisconsin. One of the one's we missed. HDU has been experimenting on him ever since. They let him out as bait. They wanted to follow whoever picked him up back to Emancipación."

To her credit, Vera did not break eye contact during this admission. And to his credit, Ezekiel did not say, "I told you so," despite having argued for years that the HDU was likely keeping novitiate prisoners, rather than killing them shortly after capture. It had been a key part of his campaign for more drastic action from the Sodality. Now though, he simply looked at Vera for a long while, before saying, "Well, I'm glad he's out. And he won't be going back. We'll protect him with our lives." There was a deep anger behind those words.

"There's more," Vera said, the calmness of her tone belying the severity of the subject matter. "I don't think Albuquerque was a coincidence."

"Of course not, you're from New Mexico. They know that and they're trying to get in your head."

"I don't think so," Vera shook her head. "The HDU aren't so sentimental or petty. They are an impersonal bureaucracy, despite the cruelties that they inflict upon us. If they chose Albuquerque, it was for a strategic reason. I think they have a sense of where Emancipación is." Ezekiel's eyes widened. Vera hurriedly added, "Not precisely, but a general sense."

Ezekiel recovered himself and nodded. "They could probably get that from the locations of the awakenings that they failed to track down. Particularly in the earlier years before we spread out. And the fact that you showed up yourself to rescue this one, they will take that as confirmation."

Vera steadied herself for a breath and considered her words carefully before proceeding. "We can't wait for them to narrow their search further. I believe that it is time for us to go on the offensive."

Ezekiel's concern transformed in a a grim anticipation. He mouth spread into an unkind smile. Vera studied his reaction. She could feel his immense power coiled and tense, ready to spring.

"This is not a decision for us alone," she continued, "We need to call a conclave, call everyone. Tomorrow I will return to Emancipación with Lucas. I want you and Ameera to split up and start recalling everyone from the satellites." She knew this would give Ezekiel the first chance to push for his preferred course of action. Vera briefly regretted the charge he had given him. *Nothing for it now. And it's not like he's wrong this time either.* She pushed her concerns aside. Let the HDU worry for once.

Ezekiel's gaze meanwhile had grown cloudy. Perhaps he was already mentally sketching out an itinerary, drawing up a packing list or just considering if he could just grab his go bag, maybe even considering possible plans of attack on HDU.

His eyes refocused. "I'll need Roseanne's and Tillie's addresses. I only have Antonio's. I know that Ameera has Arsène's, so she can head across the Atlantic. She'll also need Akin's location." Ezekiel had hit upon the same division of labor that Vera had: California, Detroit, and Philadelphia for Ezekiel; Paris and Lagos for Ameera.[^15]

[^15]: In order to preserve operational security, no single person in the Sodality knew all of the safe house locations, not even Vera. She knew the cities of each one, which was more than most, but only a few of the specific addresses. Ezekiel knew the specific address of their central California site because he himself had set it up. For the others he only knew general regions.

"Go to Antonio first. He knows where Roseanne is and she knows where Tillie is. They had to sort out their jurisdictional boundary." Ezekiel nodded, recalling that discussion. "I will tell Ameera where to find Akin. But wait until after we leave tomorrow. Lucas deserves our presence."

Ezekiel looked ready to protest but caught himself. Vera could feel him reaching out to check on Lucas, who had never made it to washing up. Instead he was fast asleep in the guest room, lying on top of all the sheets and blankets. "You're right," Ezekiel said. "Tomorrow. Come on, Vera, let's go inside."

***

The next morning, Ezekiel walked upstairs to the guestroom and knocked on the door. "Wake up, sleepy head. Vera and Meer are cooking breakfast."

An instant later, there was a loud crack as the door blew off its hinges with enough force to throw Ezekiel across the hall and crush him against the opposite wall. This last did not happen though. Instead Ezekiel caught the door with his mind before it had even traveled an inch. It did not even touch him, despite how close his still raised hand was to the wooden surface.

"Woah there, brother. You're safe here." He slowly rotated the door out into the hallway and leaned it against the wall, examining the frame to see what kind of repairs would be necessary. Lucas had rolled off the far side of the bed, perhaps by accident, and was cowering.

"E... Ezekiel?" he stammered.

"In the flesh."

Lucas's head poked up over the edge of the bed. "I'm so sorry! I thought I was back at the Walls and They had me and I didn't mean to break your Door and --"

Ezekiel raised a hand to quiet Lucas, laughing loudly. "It's perfectly alright. I've taught quite a few novitiates at this point. Believe me, this is far from the worst thing someone has done by accident." He paused, then grinned at Lucas. "You got more pep than the average novitiate though, I'll give you that. Don't lose that. You'll need it soon enough." There was something vaguely ominous in his tone. Lucas looked at him, confused, but Ezekiel offered no clarification. "Come on now. Go shower and get your scrawny butt downstairs for food. I can't imagine those bastards fed you well." With that Ezekiel turned and headed back down the stairs.

***

By the time Lucas made his way downstairs, still dripping from his first shower in more than a decade, breakfast was served and folks were already eating, grabbing pancakes and scooping eggs off of communal plates in the center of the round table. Lucas' eyes widened at the sight of a hot home-cooked meal. His stomach let out an audible rumble. 

Vera smiled at the soggy-haired novitiate and beckoned him to sit. "Come and eat your fill," she said.

"Yes!" Ezekiel added. "Meer and Vera are both excellent cooks!" 

Vera narrowed her eyes at Ezekiel. "Have you been making Ameera do all of the cooking?"

Ezekiel lowered his gaze. "Not *all* of it," he said abashedly.

Vera looked at Ameera, her eyebrows creased. Ameera met her gaze placidly. The younger woman continued to eat while maintaining eye contact. There was not hint of avoidance in that look, but neither was there confirmation or denial. 

"That's what I thought," said Vera, turning back to the accused. "E, when are you going to learn to cook for yourself?"

"But she's so much better at it!" Ezekiel protested.

"Only because you never practice," Vera replied archly. "Ameera, dear, I apologize for how I raised him."

"Raised me? I was twenty years old when you found me!"

Now it was Vera's turn to look at Ezekiel blankly, as those his words, rather than being wrong, simply contained no meaning whatsoever. Ezekiel raised his hands in surrender. "Okay, okay, I'm sorry for bringing shame upon you."

Lucas watched this exchange intently, his eyes darting from person to person, drinking in this experience of human relations as fervently as he stuffed food into his mouth.

"Look at him eat! See how good your cooking is?" Ezekiel tried to salvage his position.

"He's been locked up for about a decade. God knows what they've been feeding him. I'm sure he would be overjoyed to eat even your cooking, E." Vera conceded not an inch.

"Then look at how enthusiastically *I* am eating!" Ezekiel retorted as he redoubled his gustatory efforts. Ameera hid a smile behind her hand.

The familial banter went on as the piles of food dwindled. Lucas mostly ate silently and watched, wondering if he would have such a rapport with these three. Or with anyone. Maybe his long isolation had set him apart, never to experience such closeness again. He still couldn't believe that he had just slept in a room with an unlocked door. Four times in the night he had gotten up to check it by hand, even though he could sense the lock perfectly well from the bed. He wanted to cry. He almost did at several points during the meal, only to receive a comforting smile from Ameera or to catch the glance of patient, unjudging eyes from Vera. Ezekiel several times tried to involve Lucas in the conversation with a question or a joke but Lucas could only respond with startled stammering. The older man didn't press the issue and instead picked up the conversation as if no interruption had occurred.

Eventually the rate of consumption slowed and relaxed pauses in the conversation grew longer. Ezekiel slapped the table, causing Lucas to jump, though he managed to prevent himself from lashing out with any telekinetic flailing. 

"Well, I certainly missed this," said Ezekiel, barely containing a laugh at Lucas's shock. "I'm certainly looking forward to seeing Emancipación again."

"And we will be glad to welcome both of you back," Vera replied. "But now, we should all prepare to depart."

Before anyone could rise from the table, Ameera politely spoke up, "Pardon me, Madame, but may I speak to Brother Lucas privately for a moment?"

"Of course, dear," Vera said in an amused tone, though Lucas couldn't tell whether it was in response to the question or to being called "Madame. 

Ameera rose, gently grabbed Lucas' hand and led him out of the room. Vera and Ezekiel remained sitting, watching the two younger adults depart. There was an expression of pride on Vera's face.

After they were gone, Ezekiel quietly asked, "So what is that about?"

"Do you know why I sent Ameera to you?" Vera answered with a question of her own.

A flicker of annoyance crossed Ezekiel's face at Vera's customary Socratic pedagogical method. "To learn from me how to reach her full telekinetic potential," he said. His tone was a defiant stating of the obvious, a refusal to play Vera's game.

Vera nodded slowly, choosing not to acknowledge the petulance, though her following words certainly contained a rebuke. "Yes, but that was only half of it. I also sent her here so that you could learn from her. From what I have seen this past day, she's a better student than you are."

"Learn what? How to cook?"

If Vera was annoyed at the semi-sarcastic response, she did not show it, not even to Ezekiel's sensitive extrasensory abilities. Instead she simply rose and began to walk out of the dining room. "It's time to go, E. Since you didn't cook, you can do the dishes," she called over her shoulder.

Ezekiel watched her go, then let out an exasperated sigh. He rose from the table and all the dishes rose with him. They sorted and stacked themselves before following him into the kitchen like a row of ducklings. 

***

Out in the backyard, Ameera and Lucas stood facing each other, both of his soft, uncalloused hands clasped in her cool fingers.

"Brother Lucas, you must listen." Ameera was looking intently into Lucas' eyes now. He struggled to maintain the eye contact, his shy nervousness drawing his eyes in every other direction in desperate pursuit of some measure of privacy. To her nose, her ear, the porch behind her. He forced himself to look back at the dark pupils ringed in green. He felt like Ameera was peering into his very soul. *Where was the shy young woman who barely managed to introduce herself yesterday?*

"You are lonely and wondering if you will ever be loved or feel safe," This was not a question. There was a firm certainty in Ameera's soft voice. 

Lucas' eyes widened in astonishment. *Could our powers be used to read minds?* he thought to himself in alarm.

"You *are* safe. You *are* loved. You are not alone. You are with us now and we are with you. We will not abandon you. Do not worry if you do not feel that way now. It will come."

Tears began streaming down Lucas' face. He had stifled tears for so many years among Walls. Now, here he was, crying every day now. He hated feeling vulnerable after having inured himself to so much. He wanted to believe Ameera's words, but how could he? He was broken. She was not.

"You are wondering if we can possibly understand you." Once again Ameera spoke directly to his unspoken fears. "We do understand your loss. Each of us had to leave our lives and families behind after our awakenings. I left behind two younger sisters and my father. I loved them very much. I still do. I sometimes cry when I think about the hurt I did to them when I left." Now Ameera's eyes were watering. Still though, she didn't look away or break eye contact.

"I do not know what you suffered. I am sorry we did not rescue you sooner. But you must trust Madame Kelly. She also didn't have anyone to rescue her. She also suffered much. And now she works to make us not suffer. This can be you. We cannot take back your suffering. But you can help make sure no one else suffers like you. Do you understand, Brother Lucas? Will you trust her?" She continued to stare into Lucas' eyes, searching his face, his soul, for an answer that seemed to help some momentous importance.

"Yes... I think so," Lucas managed to choke out between sobs, his voice a harsh whisper. "It's just... I don't know. I'll try. I'll try."

Ameera smiled at him then, a smile of nearly pure delight, only barely inflected with some deep sorrow. She pulled Lucas into an embrace with her arms and her mind. Lucas did not stiffen. Instead, he felt some deep tension leave his body. He relaxed into being completely encompassed in a tight but gentle embrace beyond the potential of mere flesh and bones. His weeping slowly quieted into sniffles.

"Trust Vera," Ameera repeated, whispering into his ear. "She knows much."

Still wrapped in that embrace, Lucas turned some portion of his attention to the gray-haired woman who was currently packing food into bags in the kitchen. As he studied her frame and motions, he wondered what she had endured, what scars lay beneath her calm confidence.

## Chapter 4 - A Flight

*Forty four years before the Proclamation*

The several months following Vera's awakening would account for the most miserable portion of Vera's life. While she would certainly witness greater horrors and sorrows, suffer more profound trials of the soul, it was this period that would haunt her most deeply. For the rest of Vera's life, she would find herself waking in terror from dreams of snow and darkness and pursuit, sure that she had slept too long and was about to be caught, tortured, and ignominiously murdered. She would sit straight up and frantically clutch at the bramble necklace under her shirt, reassuring herself that it was intact, that she was safe, that years had elapsed since that time, and that she had in fact rescued numerous individuals from the very fate that her nightmare had threatened. Vera would harden her heart to the emotional loss she experienced then and try, often futility, to return to sleep.

Vera never sought to deliberately hide the impact that this period had upon her. The bare facts of the events were an important part a novitiate's indution into the Sodality, a way of explaining how they had come to be there. But whenever Vera spoke of this time, be it to a novitiate, a peer, or a trusted friend, she did so with a certain flatness of tone that exceeded her usual coolness. It was a mark that simultaneously masked and highlighted a deep hurt, one that she struggled to convey. Vera was always willing to help others and sacrifice on their behalf, but she truly never learned how to accept help from others. Sensing this, her comrades never pried too deeply into this period of her life.

***

*One foot in front of the other.* Vera trudged up the mountainside, one snow shoe and then the other, step by step. The mountain slopes were quiet today. Some combination of the time of year and perhaps the day of the week, though Vera had long lost track of such things. The only sounds she could hear were her own labored breathing, the crunch of snow, and the soft creaking of her gear, all dampened by the thick snow surrounding her. She stopped hiking to catch her breath. Her own noises now stilled, she could hear the winter wind whispering through the evergreens of the Green Mountains of Vermont. She leaned on her hiking sticks and look up at the sparse canopy of snow-dappled needles, backlit by the cloudy sky. She studied those needles, how they glistened and sparkled as she swayed slightly, how they were able to support so much snow on such narrow bodies, how much she hated them.

She hated the pine needles and the trees on which they grew. She detested the cloudy skies and the chill winds. She absolutely loathed the snow underfoot and the rocky mountains she spent every day hiking up and down. It didn't matter that she had once loved these forests and mountains, spent every opportunity she could hiking among them. That prior adoration is why she knew how to use the snow shoes she now wore and the skis now strapped to her back. It was why she knew how to camp safely and (reasonably) comfortably in a New England winter. 

It also didn't matter that this very same terrain and snow and cold was very likely what was keeping her alive, as it slowed her pursuers just as much, if not more so, than her. All she knew at this moment was that she hated it all and that she fervently wanted to be anywhere but here, doing anything but this. She felt a desperate scream of rage welling up inside her. With no small effort, she managed to keep it from bursting forth. She almost physically tamped it down, deep in her belly, until the moment passed. Screaming on such a quiet day might attract unwanted attention. She mentally examined her surroundings, checking whether her near-outburst had caused her to lower her guard and emit vibrations into the ether. Thankfully, she had not.

Vera lowered her head and resumed her trek. *One more hour.* It was just after 2pm, a fact that she only knew from her digital watch, as the cloudy sky obscured the sun and her circadian rhythm was completely shot. *One more hour and then I can rest.* Or do something approximating rest at least. Vera didn't dare sleep for more than four hours. Hadn't done so in months, a fact which no doubt heavily contributed to her desire to scream at nothing. A dozen mountains' worth of exhaustion weighed heavily upon her.

***

Vera's flight into the Green Mountains of Vermont had been remarkably smooth. The few hours drive had been unimpeded by pursuing vans or men in masks. Even more mundane traffic had been blessedly sparse, as was to be expected on a weekday morning. She had chosen the destination for its combination of remoteness (about as much as you could get in New England) and her familiarity with the terrain. Vera had grown up hiking in the high desert of New Mexico and she had maintained this interest at university, joining every shared ride into the mountains that she could and serving in various leadership positions in the university outdooring club. It didn't escape her that her awakening had occurred while daydreaming of just such a trip. 

Her hope was that the location was remote enough to delay any response by her pursuers (if not being outside the range of their sensors altogether, though Vera wasn't relying upon that). The region would also provide her with plenty of escape routes that vehicles couldn't easily follow. These factors were critical because, while Vera could dampen the signal she emanated by deliberate, conscious effort, such focus was difficult to maintain for sustained periods of time. And Vera was experiencing the stress of fleeing for her life in a stolen car while trying to think of a way out of this situation, a situation that was further compounded by Vera's need for sleep. She had spent most of the night hidden in the university tunnels and the early morning embarking on this journey. She didn't dare pull over for a roadside nap however, for one simple and terrifying reason: she couldn't consciously dampen her signal if she were sleeping.

Her plan had thus been as follows:

1) Use combination of theft and whatever cash Vera had on hand[^6] to obtain food and camping supplies. This she had done shortly after crossing into Vermont.
2) Hike up into the mountains, pitch a tent and sleep for maybe four hours.
3) Rise and quickly relocate to a vantage point from where she could monitor her recent campsite.
4) Watch for signs of her pursuers. If they didn't show, she could risk sleeping for longer. If they did, she could use another stolen car and her own two feet to relocate to another remote enough spot to risk sleeping again.
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until she could think of something better.

[^6]:Vera didn't dare use a credit card out of concern that her pursuers could track its use. Fortunately, as virtually all novitiates swiftly realized, telekinesis and even a modicum of cleverness makes theft a rather trivial endeavor. At least for those who lack compunction about the matter.  

It was not a great plan, Vera knew. Honestly, it was a pretty shit plan in her estimation. But it was the best she could come up with at the moment. 

Unfortunately, her pursuers did, in fact, show up during Step 4. It took fours hours for the ground forces to arrive, long enough that Vera had almost allowed herself to hope that they wouldn't find her here, that she could rest and plan at her leisure.

The circling plane was what had prevented even the small luxury of hope. When she had woken from her all too brief rest, a small plane was flying overhead. As she packed up her tent, the plane had swiftly departed, leading Vera to wonder if it had just been a joyrider out of a local general aviation airport. But less than an hour later, it, or a similar aircraft, had returned. By this time, Vera had already moved some distance off uphill. She continued to put distance between herself and her campsite, making sure to stay under treecover. This is why she had prioritized "acquiring" gear in shades of green and brown. She was heading up the mountainside to a rocky outcropping. When she reached it, the plane was still there, methodically tracing the path of an ox plow in the sky, occasionally returning to where she had just departed. Vera settled into a shaded crevice in the rock and waited.

In due course, she saw the same train of vans and SUVs on the mountain road below her, snaking their way to the nearest trailhead. She checked her watch, jotted down the time in a notebook, then monitored them for a moment through a pair of purloined binoculars, confirming their identity and looking for any useful new information. Nothing of note. She sighed, shouldered her pack, and set off again, a portion of her attention focused on dampening her incessant signal all the while. 

So it was for the coming days, then weeks, then months. A few hours sleep, then flight. One trail after another. An endless parade of stolen cars. An occasional trip into town to steal additional supplies (Vera had long since run out of her own cash, though she occasionally found more in the cars she "borrowed"). Her schedule did not follow the cycle of the sun. She found herself hiking and driving at all hours in a desperate attempt to retain her freedom. All the while her exhaustion grew. Sometimes, due to an unexpected stumble or just a wandering mind, her focus on her own signal wavered. Such a mistake would force her to travel further before stopping again and added yet more to her exhaustion, which in turn threatened to increase the frequency of stumbles and distractions in a viscous feedback loop. Vera had to thread a narrow gap, estimating how many hours she could safely sleep before her pursuers arrived. An error in one direction would lead to her immediate capture. An error in the other would lead to a spiral of diminishing faculties and a somewhat delayed, but just as certain, capture.

She didn't know how long she could keep this up. Anything could undo her. Sleeping through an alarm. Crashing a car on mountain roads. An attentive highway patrol officer, perhaps tipped off by her pursuers, could recognize her car as stolen. A clerk could notice her shoplifting. And then what would she do? Use her powers to fight them off? What if they pulled a gun? Could she disarm them in time?

***

Now, several months and a several dozen mountains later, Vera had upgraded her evaluation of the plan from"pretty shit" to "incredibly shit," particularly because she was yet to reach the "think of something better" step. Over time, a desperate excitement had given way to resignation. Now her resignation was giving way to a desperate weariness. 

*One foot in front of the other. Another 45 minutes, maybe.* She tried to distract herself from her woes by thinking of happier times. Hiking (in much warmer weather) with her parents as a child. Laughing with Delilah about how some of the other freshmen on the floor of their dorm had tried to turn the hallway into a slip-and-slide with an abhorrent mixture of soap and lube. It varied from day to day whether such memories buoyed her spirits or just made the loneliness more unbearable.[^7] Vera had always considered herself to be fairly self-sufficient. She certainly was no social butterfly. Nonetheless, while Vera had no siblings and only a tense relationship with her parents, she never doubted that they cared about her wellbeing (or at least their definition of her wellbeing). And they were a familiar presence at least. Now she had no idea how long it would be before she could safely contact them, much less see them in person. Maybe never. Her pursuers were well equipped and numerous. Reaching out to her parents would not only endanger Vera, it would put her parents at risk, making them into appealing means of leverage if they weren't already. There was no guarantee that this precaution would preserve her parents' safety, but it was the best option available to her at the moment. Her parents would simply have to endure the pain of losing their only child. And Vera had to forge a path without their assistance or even their judgement.[^8]  

[^7]:While every member of the Sodality could empathize with being so suddenly cut off from all friends and family, it was more difficult to understand the depths of Vera's loneliness at this time. Later novitiates would have the Sodality to provide comfort and instruction in absence of their prior relations. And once the Sodality was firmly established, some entire families were brought into hiding alongside the members. Vera had no such support. 

[^8]:The HDU never did intervene in the lives of Vera's parents, choosing instead to closely monitor them for the rest of their lives in hope that Vera would slip up and contact them. They both died long before Vera revealed herself to the world and went to their graves believing, though with no definitiveness, that their daughter had been kidnapped and murdered.

The same held for Vera's friends. Her detached inquisitiveness had prevented a certain level of intimacy, it is true, but this did not mean that Vera had no close friends. She was, or had been, a young woman in an urban college far from her small hometown, experiencing a certain kind of freedom for the first time. And while her school was academically rigorous to be sure, the students also played hard. She attended parties, tried new hobbies like firespinning and sailing, and participated in the social life of her dorm and co-op. She had become quite close with her freshmen year roommate, Delilah, and the two had even elected to move to the co-op together to maintain their personal and cohousing relationship. 

But Vera had fled all that. No longer would she and Delilah cut each other's hair.[^9] No longer would they laugh at each other's jokes and at the dumb things they had said to the red head on their floor whom they both had a crush on. No longer would they rise in the morning to a shared alarm. Instead Delilah would wake each morning to an empty room and wonder where their friend had gone. Tears came to Vera's eyes now, so she hurriedly changed her line of thought.

[^9]: Vera's hair was a straight black, kept short, Delilah's a long wavy brown that Vera was frequently called upon to braid, an action that Vera took great pleasure in, though she never told Delilah as much. Vera would later refer to this as one of her greatest regrets.

She even shunned other hikers, viewing them as potential spies. Gone were the days of a friendly greeting, a short discussion of the trail condition ahead, or a playful interaction with a cute dog. Frequently she abandoned marked trails all together, choosing to cut through woods and follow animal paths, although as winter had set in, this had become less and less necessary, particularly so long as she stayed away from ski resorts. The primary source of novelty in her life was the occasional jaunt over to the White Mountains of New Hampshire when the HDU cordon seemed to be drawing too close about her.

The crack of a branch nearby startled her back to her present surroundings. She froze and listened. Then, ever so slowly and carefully, she reached out her awareness to examine the area. Nothing. Likely a dead branch simply broke from the accumulated snow. Nevertheless, it took a long time for her body to relax and the adrenaline to dissipate. When it finally did, she was left with a cold nausea. 

The uncertainly and the paranoia that uncertainty bred were further burdens upon her mind and body. Vera still knew precious little about the intent and capabilities of her pursuers. She knew hardly any more about her own power: its bounds, its origin, its nature, or how it might develop. Her future was completely unclear. While Vera was not one to map out her future in great detail,[^10] she had previously had the comfortable confidence in the future that is natural to a middle class upbringing and attendance at a prestigious university. That comfortable, if vague, future had vanished like a soap bubble upon her flight. All she knew for certain was that her life to come would be hard and, in all likelihood, cruelly short.

[^10]:Even prior to her awakening, Vera had no particular envisioned career beyond grad school, nor did she have a clear idea as to where she would like to live or whether she would ever marry or have children. While she was a meticulous planner, she was cautious about overplanning in the face of uncertainty.

***

The hike continued. Her planned camping spot only a short way ahead now. For all the snow and elevation, her muscles felt fine, at least if you call a dull ache fine. Her physical condition was one of all too few things she was thankful for. She was already in shape prior to her flight, capable of long backpacking trips through the mountains. The past few months had only enhanced that. Gone was the slim fitness of a collegiate amateur athlete. Now Vera all stringy muscles capable of propelling her up and down mountains day after day. Despite being well fed by frequent thieving, her body fat was virtually gone. Her face had gone from the plump softness of youth to a gaunt boniness, her dark eyes sunken and rimmed with the signs of exhaustion. Though she didn't want to admit it, part of her aversion to hikers was just to prevent scaring them with her haggardness.

She rounded one last corner and saw the spot she was looking for. To anyone else, it would have looked like every other patch of forest in this region, but to her it was a close to perfect as she could imagine. It was just beneath a pass that had excellent visibility in multiple directions. The nearest road was blessedly far. And it was heavily forested, which deterred her pursuers from parachuting or deploying from a helicopter. They had done neither thus far (maybe because of the winter weather?) but Vera wasn't going to wait for them to make the attempt.

She set her pack down, got her tent set up, and put water on to boil on her camp stove. A short, hot meal later, she was feeling... perhaps not reinvigorated, but certainly feeling instead of the dull emotional numbness that was most days.  *Now, rest or experiment?* She craved nothing so much as the former, but knew that the only way out of this mess was the latter. 

As almost always happened at this point in Vera's all-too-short "days," she found her mind drifting back to the last time she had dared to hope for a full night's rest, only to have that lovely promise snatched away from her. 

***

One afternoon, only a month into her flight, had found her hiking up yet another mountain, daydreaming of happier times from her childhood in a what she had even then thought was a pitiful attempt to buoy her flagging spirits (college memories were too recent to be without pain). The joy of sledding down the dunes of White Sands. The excited terror of seeing a mountain lion for the first time at age ten, crouched on the ledge of a box canyon, pointed out by her father. Gazing in wonder at the vaulted ceilings of Carlsbad Caverns.

Her plodding hike came to an abrupt halt. She blinked her unfocused eyes repeatedly. *I could hide in a cave*. She did not know if she said this out loud or merely thought it. Just as the concrete of the tunnels had hid her once, the natural tunnels of the Earth could shelter her now. *How come I didn't think of this sooner?* She only briefly allowed for berating herself before refocusing on next steps. She sat down on a rock and dug through her pack for a caffeine tablet. She needed to be alert.

Could she flee to Carlsbad or one of the many large caves of the border region? There were miles upon miles of tunnels inaccessible to the public. It should be easy enough to find a secluded place to lay down and rest. Her powers meant that she could navigate perfectly well in the dark. Maybe if she stayed there long enough, she would become some kind of pale cave monster out of a horror movie. This thought made her laugh, a prolonged, delirious laugh that went on and on. Any passing hiker on the blessedly empty trail would have thought her insane or intoxicated. As strained as the laughter was, it was the first moment of joy she had felt in those long weeks. 

She was mentally routing out a trip to New Mexico - *Am I fit enough state to make the trip in one shot? Doubtful* - when she had another realization, one even more retrospectively obvious than taking shelter in a cave. New England has caves. None as large as Carlsbad, certainly, but they didn't have to be. They just needed to have enough rock and dirt to block out that infuriating signal. How much that was, Vera didn't know, but she could experiment, just as she had been doing.

A moment later trail maps and tourist guides were hastily pulled out of her pack and spread across the trail. Vera poured over them, looking for a nearby cave, preferably a deep one. Her eyes lit upon a promising candidate and she let out another loud, wild laugh. Hurriedly, she repacked her things and set out at once.

Vera never even saw the cave mouth.

As soon as she pulled into the trailhead parking lot, she tensed. A large, unmarked black van was already parked there. An unusual, but not unheard of, vehicle for a group of hikers. She pulled into a spot in the opposite corner as nonchalantly as she could. She left the car running and began digging out her notebook. The worn plastic covered book came loose and she began flipping through the somewhat damp and dirt smudged pages. She found what she was looking for and starting sliding her finger along rows of alphanumeric sequences, each one a license plate that she had seen on one of the vehicles pursuing her thus far. 

Her finger stopped its downward path. There it was, Massachusetts UV8HA3. They were already here. *Of course they were!* A cave was the obvious place for her to go to ground. If she hadn't been so sleep deprived, she would have thought of it herself sooner, weeks sooner. Hell, she should have realized it when she was first driving to Vermont. She *would* have if all this hadn't been just *so damn much!* 

With that thought, her stoic resolve broke. She broke down in loud, gasping sobs, the fear and anger and impotence and exhaustion suddenly finding vent. She wept bitterly and beat her fist against the steering wheel hard enough to bruise her hand. Heavy tears pouring down her cheeks, blinding her eyes to the world. All focus on dampening her signal was gone. She no longer cared if the men in the van found her, if the whole damned world found her. She let her pent up awareness pour out of her, washing over the dirt of the parking lot, the cars, the trees, the trail, and every scurrying and fluttering creature nearby. It felt like spreading her wings, stretching out like she never had before. She tried to convey her frustration and sorrow to every living and inanimate thing within her mental reach. She felt the birds take flight in terror, the rodents futilely go to ground, the trees shudder at a sensation novel to them. And she felt the men in the white van, already roused from their complacency by the beeping of an alarm, experience some portion of the dread that she herself had been experiencing.

*This was their fault.* If it weren't for them, she would still be in Boston. She would still have her family, her hobbies, her classes. She would still have Delilah. She would be able to sleep. Why were they hunting her? Why couldn't they leave her alone? Why did they insist on using their machines to try and steal her power away? Even now, she could feel them, see them, scrambling to activate that infernal suppressor machine.

*Enough. This ends now.*

Vera turned her fury and hate upon the van, upon the men inside it. And in the space of a heartbeat, the van crumpled in on itself, metal buckling and screaming, crushing the three occupants beyond recognition. They hardly had any time to even realize what was happening.

The immediate object of Vera's wrath eliminated, regret and horror immediately displaced her anger. *What have I done? I can fix this! I can unfold the van! I can --*

But there was no undoing that. Those people were dead by her hand. All it had taken was a thought. Vera's tears turned to frantic hyperventilating. Before she could unravel further though, before she could completely break down, Vera's crisis-mind snapped into place like the teeth of a beartrap. 

*There's nothing you can do to fix this now. Sitting here is just going to get you caught. More of them are probably already on their way. Throw the car in reverse and get the hell out of here. Harden your heart and move on.*

And that's what Vera did. She told herself she would reflect on this, mourn properly, try to make amends, when she had escaped this trap. 

She did not try hiding in any other caves in Vermont. She didn't flee to Carlsbad. Instead she resumed her stuttering traversal of the Green Mountains. It was miserable. It was exhausting. But it meant that no one had to die. This is what she kept telling herself during the following months, as the temperatures dropped, as the days grew shorter, and as her sanity and soul slowly withered.

***

Vera sighed deeply. She still avoided grappling with the death, no the murder, of those three individuals. She supposed she would need to do so eventually, but she was too exhausted for that kind of emotional work. Right now it was only hiking, resting, or experimenting. *Fuck it. It''s been almost a week since I last tried something. I can't keep pushing it off. Let's do an hour and then I'll sleep.*

She dug around in her backpack for her current notebook and began flipping through it, reminding herself of where she had left off, no longer trusting her weariness-addled memory. Ever since fleeing into the mountains, Vera had been experimenting with her powers. This was a slow, painstaking process of self-discovery, developing and discarding theories, following lines of thought that would ultimately lead nowhere. Her progress was further hampered not only the sleep deprivation that dulled her usually quick mind, but the effort required to use her abilities discreetly while simultaneously masking her signal. She could only manage it for about an hour each day, if that. Sometimes days would go by before she could spare the time and energy to further her investigations.

Nonetheless, she was able to learn a great deal as the weeks turned into months and filled first one and then several notebooks with combinations of subjective descriptions of experiences and numerical records of the results of controlled experiments. She even considered abandoning or destroying the older notebooks to save weight during her peregrination, but couldn't overcome her fear that one of them may hold the key to escaping this Sisyphean hell. 

One of the first things she learned was that with proper focus, her awareness could stretch many miles through open air. More than a dozen at least and possibly much further with proper rest and concentration, though her ability to exert any meaningful force diminished much closer than that. 

In her second month of hiking, she learned that, with practice, her ability for fine control was great indeed. If she was forced to defend herself again, she wouldn't have to resort to anything as crude as crushing a van. A collapsed pharynx, a torn aorta, or some burst cranial vessels would all work just as quickly and no less fatally. On the less lethal side, she became confident in her ability to disarm and unbalance any assailant, to be followed by a swift flight on her part. A literal flight perhaps, as she could indeed levitate herself (every child's dream, though Vera could not relish the experience in her current state). More realistically though, by amplifying her steps and dampening her landings, she could sprint in amazing leaps and bounds far faster than an Olympian runner. All of this depended on her staying outside of the range of those suppressor machines, of course.

But most of her efforts had been focused much closer at hand, on figuring out how to dampen her signal in a less active way. Towards this end, she focused on studying the ripples that echoed for when she exerted her powers, trying to understand exactly what she was doing instinctively when she dampened those ripples. This took here a long time to understand. Her breakthrough had come only maybe four or five months in (she had lost track of time by this point). It happened when she realized that she had been conceptualizing this ripples as fundamentally analogous to light, able to move through a vacuum independent of a material medium. This was incorrect. There *was* a medium. These ripples were more akin to water and sound than light. Through a sort of deliberate unfocusing and acclimatization not dissimilar to crossing one's eyes for a prolonged period of time, Vera found that she could indeed perceive the undisturbed medium itself. It was like a spider web, connecting all things, in cascading fractals from the mountain she sat upon down to the size of a grain of sand. Smaller even, she was sure, if her awareness could have reached further. 

It took a great deal of practice before she could observe the web for any meaningful amount of time. If she looked at it too intently, too directly, her mental gaze snapped back into focus and the vision was lost. This difficulty was perhaps to her benefit, as it was beautiful, sparkling and rippling under the gentlest touch of her mind. the more she looked at it, the more she longed to lose herself tracing its path, dancing along those threads. Now she had more than fear motivating her. If she could find a way out of this trap, she could spend endless hours in idle bliss, meditating on the weave that surrounded her.

This discovery was indeed the first major step towards solving her predicament. By watching the web, she realized that when she used her mind to move an object, she was crudely grabbing a bundle of threads attached to said object and tugging. By through more deliberate action, she could grab individual threads, loop and knot them over one another so that when she released her grasp, they remained bound in place. By doing so she could keep keep an object in motion without continuous action on her part. With practice, she could make a small rock levitate for hours without intervention. The threads were slippery, however, and her understanding of their behavior poor. Inevitably the knots would eventually loosen and release.[^11]

[^11]:This description of telekinesis is almost painfully naïve to a contemporary wielder of such powers or even to a moderately competent grad student in the field. When Vera later described her learning process to other members of the Sodality, even noviates were often astounded by the slow progress of her understanding. Of course these novitiates benefited from the security provided by the Sodality and the pedagogy of experienced teachers, Vera chief among them. A far cry from Vera's exhausted flight. We can point to how little the HDU and its sister agencies learned from decades of captive novitiates to make clear the difference that learning environment can make. Of course, Vera, who never fully adopted the more sophisticated conceptualizations of telekinesis that later generations developed, nevertheless exhibited far greater skill with her abilities. Perhaps the utility of those sophisticated theories developed in comfort is overrated and necessity is indeed the mother of innovation. 

She could do more than levitate a rock via this method too. Through an spherical arrangement of loose knots, she could cause the ripples from any telekinetic action within the sphere to be reflected internally and damped out. This included the signals that she passively emitted. When she made this discovery, Vera had briefly hoped that she finally cracked it, found a way for her to get a solid nights rest, an escape from this labyrinth. Unfortunately, the spherical configuration proved to be too unstable. Try as she might, she couldn't make any sphere that was large enough to fit her body last more than a few minutes. While she had learned that, if sufficiently exhausted, she could fall asleep astounding quickly (even unintentionally much to her chagrin), six minutes was not exactly enough to be meaningful.

Another arrangement showed marginally more promise. Two objects in close physical proximity could be bound together in such a way that any movement in the threads of attached to one would transmit to the other and be translated into physical vibrations rather than outwardly emanating ripples that could be easily detected. By clenching a rock in her hand or laying down and placing the rock on her chest, Vera could manage to make this effect last for as long as thirty minutes (or until the rock vibrated its way off of her). Better, but still insufficient.

***

That had been two months ago. Two miserable months of dead ends and false starts. It was mid February now. The snow had lost whatever appeal it once held for this young woman of the desert. To think that she had once planned on taking a gap year after undergrad to do as many of the through-hikes (the Appalachian, Continental Divide, and Pacific Crest Trails) as she could. At this moment, she never wanted to *see* a mountain again, much less set foot on one.

Vera looked at the last several notebook pages. Two months of banging her head against the wall. Before her were her notes on further potential refinements on the sphere and pairing arrangements, ways to potentially eke out a few more minutes of stability.

Vera snarled angrily at the book, at her own work. *A few more minutes is worthless! I need hours! I need days!* She snapped the book shut angrily, looked up at the sky, and breathed deeply. *Relax and then think.* She reevaluated her problem. The previous discovery had been made by taking a step back and unfocusing her perception. Maybe the solution could be found by doing so again. *Soft eyes. That's what I need. Soft eyes. Stop looking for the solution and just take in the scene.* She pulled out her older notebooks, one after another, placing them gently down over a small tarp that she spread over the snow for this purpose. She started pouring over them from the beginning, simultaneously looking for something she had missed and looking for nothing at all. Somewhere, there was some unfounded assumption she was making. What *wasn't* she even thinking to try? 

She was almost back up to her most recent experiments when it struck her so suddenly and powerfully it felt like a sudden slap across her cheek. It was so obvious in retrospect that she physically buried her face in her palms and shook with some manic emotion, residing somewhere between laughter and sobs. Up to now, her experiments had all been with two kinds of subjects: rocks of various sizes and her own body. Early in her flight to the mountains, she has briefly messed around with leaves and sticks, but quickly settled on rocks as objects of similar compositions that were easy to find in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, from tiny pebbles to large boulders. This made for fewer variables to consider when testing the bounds and nature of her powers. The irony was physically oppressive. She had spent the first two years of college critiquing her peers for being overly reliant on easily quantifiable measures that collapsed all the variety and complexity of nature and society. Now here she was, wasting months doing the same thing. 

After what in normal times she would have considered an impermissibly long bout of wallowing in an awkward mix of self pity and reprobation, Vera turned her attention towards rectifying her error. She began experimenting with all sorts of subjects, or at least all sorts that were readily available to her. She started with her previously abandoned leaves and sticks, before moving onto water (in both its liquid and snowy forms), grass, food items and random objects from her pack, trees, and even animals. She felt some moral qualms about the last of these, but justified it to herself by necessity. Her extrasensory awareness enabled her to easily find insects and rodents tucked in their burrows under mounds of snow.

She quickly surpassed the hour that she had allotted for experimentation prior to rest. But even if she would regret it later, she was too caught up in the thrill of discovery, of the possibility for salvation. After ninety minutes had passed, she realized that the webs attached to living things were much 'stickier' than those attached to inanimate or dead objects[^12]. Knots and loops made with with threads associated with living plants and animals last longer, *much* longer than those made with rocks and snow. As in, she literally could not perceive any degradation in her little creations over the course of minutes. 

[^12]: This is not strictly true. If one alters the 'threads' (to use Vera's parlance) of a living being, particularly for extended periods of time, the arrangement will stably persist for some time even after that being has died. This mechanism was key to later versions of the Sodality's cloaking charms, which usually took the form of a pendant of tightly woven brambles or vines. The threads would be manipulated repeatedly and incrementally as the plants grew. Then, once harvested, the effect could remain for as long as six months.

*Why didn't I think of this sooner?* She mentally shouted at herself, but this time the primary valence was excitement, not anger. *Is it time? Do I dare risk it?* Standing in the snow, she closed her eyes, turned her palms outwards, and breathed deeply for almost a minute, trying to calm herself before committing to the endeavor. At last, she slowly opened her eyes. *Yes. It is time.*

Vera walked a few short steps over to a nearby pine tree and lowered herself to the ground, her back up against the rough bark. She mentally reached out and bound herself to it, just as she had practiced so many times these past few weeks. Slowly, carefully, she released the tight clamp she had on her ripples. The tree began to softly vibrate, flakes of snowing drifting down upon her, but Vera's emanations remain quieted. She checked her watch and noted down the time in her notebook.

Minutes passed. Then an hour. There was hardly any perceptible slackening in the bond. The tree continued its murmurations, gently massaging her back through layers of shirt and winter coat. The second hour passed similarly. Then a third, and a fourth. She was halfway through the fifth when, driven by desperate need, she rose and hurriedly dropped her pants to urinate. The movement away from the tree broke the bond, but even as she crouched there relieving herself, she began shouting exuberantly. She had done it! At last! She didn't mind one bit if it meant that she would be adopting the moniker of treehugger in a more literal sense than is usual.

After she finished attending to her bodily needs, she relocated to a different, urine-free tree, pulled out her sleeping bag, curled inside, mentally knotted the threads just as she had done before. Carefully, deliberately. She studied her handiwork in detail. It seemed solid enough. She set her alarm for five hours, longer than she had slept in months, and fell instantly asleep, her excitement no impediment at all. 

Five hours later her alarm went off. She groggily checked the bond. Still there, going strong. Another two hours of sleep then. So it repeated until the eleventh hour. The bond was on the verge of coming undone. More than a bit sleep drunk, she tried retightening the strands, only to find that they were now twisted and kinked in ways that made this difficult. She grumbled a bit about this, but her pleasure at sleeping for so long, even periodically interrupted by an alarm, was such that her displeasure quickly passed. She crawled out of her sleeping bag, relocated to a different tree, rebound the knot, and proceeded to sleep for another four hours before she felt satiated. 

She awoke at dawn. To sunlight streaming through the icy evergreens. They looked so peaceful. And now she was in a state to appreciate the scene. She remained in her sleeping bag for a long time, sleepily content. This was a dawn of a new day for her too, but she no longer felt any hurry to meet it.

***

The next several days were spent refining her methodology and planning her next steps. She did not want to remain bound to stationary trees. What if she lost focus while walking about? Or if she just rolled away from the tree in her sleep? No, she needed something she could carry with her. Vera soon found that she could achieve the same effect with a necklace of woven winter flowers. Her initial instinct had been to wear it as a crown and fully embrace a the aesthetic of a fae princess, but she was worried that it would easily fall off. Practicality won out and so a necklace it was. Now she could go about her business encumbered. 

Nonetheless, joy did briefly overwhelm prudence. She found herself making another ring of flowers to rest upon her head and soon she was dancing about a snow-covered meadow in celebration, flowers adorning her crown and shoulders. Why not allow herself a bit of the faerie experience for just a moment? She laughed and sang and twirled, each leap longer than the last, until she had left the ground entirely and simply tumbled through the air. Such joy to simply be alive! 

But her joy could only sustain her for so long. Soon exhaustion overwhelmed her. Despite it only being midafternoon, she crept back into her sleeping bag, dozing off. Months of constant hiking and little sleep had taken a toll on her body and she no longer had the remorseless taskmasters of fear and necessity driving at her heels. It would be a long time before she fully recovered. Until then she would need to pace herself and sleep plenty.

So she rested and practiced her new invention until dwindling supplies of food drove her from the mountains and back to civilization. Before long, she was on the road again, driving not to another remote trailhead in the mountains, but to the south and west. She was done with the cold and the snow. Se would have nothing to do with either for a long while, maybe forever. She was going somewhere warm and dry, even in the middle of winter. She was going, if not home, somewhere not far off from it either.

## Chapter 5 - A Refuge

*Three years before the Proclamation*

The pale red pickup truck - legitimately owned, not stolen - rumbled down a dirt road that wove between the hills of San Luis Potosi.[^13] The last town of any size was more than well over an hour behind them and Lucas would have long since lost track of their location if Vera wasn't actively explaining their course. When he had expressed some surprise at her forthrightness with this information, considering how recently they had met and the fact that he had literally been tasked with reporting the location to the HDU, Vera had shrugged, smiled, and said, "I trust you."

[^13]: By some miracle, the location of the refuge that Vera Kelly established is not known to the public. While it is no longer what it once was, it may yet be what she envisioned. As such, its location and its name in this telling has been altered.

This had quieted him. Now he remained lost in his thoughts as he gazed out, watching the hills slowly grow into mountains. Vera meanwhile, could feel a certain tenseness between her shoulders release as they drew closer to home. Emancipación had been her home for more than a quarter century at this point. It was where, in truth, she had invested her soul. The dream of this place is what had saved her when she had lost hope. If it failed, so would she. 

And so, every time she left, a certain voice in the back of her mind spoke up, *This is it. This is the end. This too shall be ripped away from you. When you return you will find nothing but scorched earth.* And every time she came back, turned into the narrow valley, and saw the old wooden gate and barbed wire fence intact, relief washed over her.

Lucas perked up when the truck pulled off the road. He watched as Vera threw the shift into park and got out of the vehicle. As she walked the couple dozen feet to the gate, he examined the surroundings. Short trees and an incline blocked the view of where the path went. On the right side of the path was a dry arroyo that led into a corrugated metal pipe than ran under the fence and the main road. Everything else he could see was a mix of cactus, yucca, yellow grass, dust, and stone. Vera, with her whispy gray hair, weathered skin, and outdoor workwear, looked for all the world like she belonged here.

Vera swung the gate open, making sure to look directly at the camera hidden in a nearby tree as she did so. No doubt whoever was on guard duty would have already sensed their approach and identified precisely who they were, but it was good to follow procedure. She returned to the vehicle, an unconscious grin upon her face, and pulled the truck through the opening before stepping out once more to close the gate behind them.

"I thought it was called Emancipación," Lucas pointed at a handpainted wooden sign stacked just inside the fence, clearly visible from the road.

"It is. That over there is the historical name for the old mission. It's what the locals call it and it's what we call it whenever speaking to outsiders. To us though, it is Emancipación."

A few minutes of bouncing on the rough road and they came across the sign of non-plant-life. A surprisingly new-looking stable and a fenced off field running along the left side of the road. Five horses could be seen out in the field, all standing in the shade of the trees at one end. Next to one of the horses stood a pair of humans with their backs to the road. Both were dressed similarly in loose overalls and work shirts. Both had short, black hair. The only immediate difference was that the one on the right had slightly darker skin than the one on the left. The one on the left seemed to be explaining something to the other, pointing at the horse and speaking, though Lucas couldn't catch their words at this distance over the rumble of the engine.

Vera hit the brakes and leaned out the window. "Oy, Damián! Andrea! A word, if it ain't too much trouble!" The pair immediately swung round. Lucas now saw that the one on the left was a man with straight hair, while on the one on the right was a woman with curly hair. Both were significantly younger than he was. And both had an expression of happy surprise. 

"Vera!" They shouted in unison and came running. When they got to the barbed wire fence separating the field from the road, Damián used a fence post to vault the barrier as if it was second nature. Lucas didn't think he had used any Movement to assist, but wasn't sure. While he was starting to acclimate to the charm hung around his neck, his senses had been rattled, a bit fuzzy, ever since they entered Emancipación in a way that he couldn't quite explain.

When Andrea, following slightly behind, reached the fence, she folded her hands in front of her and floated gently up and over the fence. As her feet touched the ground again, gravity seemed to suddenly reassert itself over her and she jogged the remaining few steps more conventionally.

Vera stepped out of the car to embrace them both at once. What followed was a rapid conversation in a mix of Spanish and psychic signaling, neither of which Lucas understood, though he did catch some names that he was familiar with: Ezekiel, Ameera, Sodality. Some gestures were made at Lucas and further down the path as well. Eventually Vera stepped back from the pair and turned to Lucas.

"Step on out. Damián will give you a tour of the place on foot. I'll meet up with you later."

As Lucas exited the vehicle, Andrea walked up and warmly extended a hand. "Welcome to Emancipación, Lucas!" Lucas shyly accepted the offering. Then Andrea was passed him and hoping into his recently vacated seat in the truck. 

Lucas walked around the truck towards Vera and Damián. His savior furnished a brief introduction and then was back in the truck herself, heading further up the road.

"Bienvenido, mi hermano," Damián had a big grin on his face, as if he had just heard a good joke. "Ready to see the closest thing to heaven on Earth for someone like you or me?" The tour guide laughed, though Lucas wasn't exactly sure at what.

***

Vera stepped into the study. Heavy curtains helped keep out the summer heat, but meant that the room was dim compared to the bright sunlight that she had just exited. Vera removed her sunglasses and looked a the familiar room. It was sparsely appointed. Hand-hewn shelves full of binders and folders, a few metal filing cabinets, a couple of wooden chairs, and a secondhand desk. 

Behind that desk, sat Li Xinyue chewing on a pencil as she looked back and forth between the laptop and a handwritten receipt of some kind. Running a commune-ranch of the size of Emancipación required a surprising amount of logistics and paperwork. And that didn't even include the operations of a multinational secret society. Vera did what she could, as did a half dozen other members of the Sodality, but everyone knew that Xinyue was the real talent on this front. Novitiates often assumed that she had been a professional accountant prior to her awakening or at least training to be one.[^24]

[^24]: This was not, in fact true. Xinyue was an undergraduate in Women's and Gender Studies at the time of her awakening. Both of her parents were accountants, however.

Vera pulled a spare chair across the desk from Xinyue and sat down. She placed her hands on her lap and patiently waited for the younger woman to finish her work. Vera generally tried to avoid interrupting others, but inevitably members of the Sodality tended to drop what they were doing when she had need of them. Xinyue, the first novitiate she had rescued, was an exception.

The accountant of Emancipación stuck the pencil behind her ear to type something. Her long black hair draped behind her in a ponytail. Like most residents of Emancipación, she wore outdoor work attire but her clothes somehow managed to convey a certain cleanliness and propriety that others lacked. In a moment, the pencil was back in her mouth.

"You didn't come back with the money." A statement not a question. This is how Xinyue commonly was, direct and straightforward, with little-to-no small talk.

"Something came up. Will it be a problem?"

"I already sent out Aubrey to make it up."

"Was that necessary?"

"Ordinarily no, but wars cost money."

A long silence stretched between the two. Vera was continually impressed with Xinyue's attention and astuteness. Their powers meant that it was possible to monitor virtually anything happening in Emancipación. Actually being able to process all that information at all, much less drawing conclusions from that information while performing another task was not something made any easier by telekinesis. 

Eventually Xinyue carefully set the pencil down, moved the receipt to a folder, and closed the laptop. She leaned forward on one arm, her fingers across her brow and her thumb on her cheek. Her eyes focused on her mentor. Those eyes held a turbulent set of emotions in them. Sadness to be sure. Some regretful excitement too. Then those eyes closed and she spoke. 

"It will be war, won't it?"

If virtually anyone else was asking that question, Vera would have deflected. "That's for the Sodality to decide." "We'll see." "Do you think that's what we should do?" With Xinyue, however, Vera answered directly: "Yes. If not now, then soon."

"I'm scared." This was not a plea for comfort. It was not an appeal to authority. It was not even an expression of a desire to avoid what was coming. It was simply an expression of honesty to a trusted friend.

"So am I."

Another silence.

"How is he? This Lucas Hayward?"

"Better than I expected, considering what he's been through. He has a strong soul. I wish that we had been faster." It was Vera's turn to put lean her face on a hand. "I sent Andrea to notify everyone and make sure a room is prepared. We will have to be careful with teaching him."

"Well we have a bounty of qualified teachers now, particularly with everyone returning for a conclave. It's not like when I was a novitiate." 

That gentle ribbing elicited a light chuckle from Vera. "I was a bit much, wasn't I? Teaching you to try and save myself. I shouldn't have put that on you. God, how the years have mellowed me."

"You're wrong there." Mirth shone in Xinyue's dark eyes.

"Oh?"

"You're still trying to save yourself by teaching us. Just ask the novitiates. We find it awfully endearing actually."

Vera stuck out her tongue in response.

"Now that's no way for our Dear Leader, the Savior of Telepaths, the Old Woman of the Mountain, *Our Lady of Emancipación* to behave."

"Young lady, I am none of those things!"

Xinyue threw her hands in the hair. "Don't blame me. I didn't originate any of those epithets."

Vera looked genuinely abashed. "They *did not*."

Xinyue burst out laughing. A moment later, Vera did followed suit.

***

"There's the mess hall. It doubles as spot for community meetings. Unless the weather is nice, in which case we meet at the amphitheater over here." Damián turned out to be an excellent tour guide, effortlessly walking backwards while pointing out objects of interest. He also was able to graciously break his running dialogue to introduce fellow telekinetics they came across then pick back up as if nothing had happened. Lucas was awash in names and worried that he wouldn't be able to remember them all.

"You'll have to do a couple shifts a week in there."

"What if I don't know how to cook?" Lucas asked nervously, mentally adding another worry to the growing list.

"No worries! Flora and Aubrey manage the kitchen. You'll basically be their assistant to start out. They're great teachers." This did little to assuage Lucas' concerns but he didn't push the issue. He had met Flora earlier on the tour and she seemed... intimidating.

"There's the old bell tower." Damián was pointing at a tall adobe tower now. It was not in good condition, to say the least, with large chunks missing from the walls and most of the wooden roof missing.  The tower was a striking contrast to most of the buildings they had passed, which were all either recently constructed or clearly refurbished and kept in good condition. "From back when this was a mission. The bell itself is long gone. We haven't fixed it up yet because we haven't decided what to do with it. Do you have any ideas?"

Lucas shook his head.

"Well, if you think of anything, let us know. All it does at the moment is house the emergency siren that Antonio set up a few years back."

"Why do you need a siren? Can't you just signal everyone?"

"Backup in case HDU catches us by surprise with a suppressor field. We have lots of redundancies like that. Can't just rely on our powers to protect us."

Lucas could understand that. His powers hadn't been able to protect him after all. Then again, the people here seemed so casually proficient with their abilities. He found it hard to imagine anyone being able to defeat them.

They passed by the bell tower and came across fields full of orderly crops stretching further up the valley. Lucas could see a variety of vegetables, herbs, and grains from here, though he would be hard pressed to identify any of them. Agriculture was not exactly helpful knowledge amid the Walls.

"Here's where we grow food, obviously. Both for us to eat and for us to sell. Julian - you met Julian earlier - runs the farm. You'll also need to put in some shifts up here. Our powers mean we don't need as many hands as most farms, but that doesn't mean Julian can do it alone."

From near the beginning, the appearance of Emancipacion and Damián's descriptions of life here unsettled Lucas in some vague way. It wasn't until now,  at the end of the tour that he was able to describe it to himself somewhat more clearly. The dining hall, the stables, the farm, the workshop, the art studio, the study, the library.  This place doesn't look like a secret haven of telepaths preparing for war. Rather, it looked more like a Homeward Bound camp that Lucas had visited one summer as a child. Or a hippie commune of some kind.  

Something of Lucas' disquiet must have showed on his face, because Damián halted his tour guide spiel mid-sentence.  
  
"Something wrong, friend? Hopefully I am not that bad of a guide."  
  
"It's all so normal! Everyone is doing normal things!" Lucas blurted. *Not that I really know anything about normal.*  
  
The newcomer's explanation was met with a short, sharp bark of a laugh.  
  
"Of course!" Damián said. "We don't exactly want to hang out a sign that says '*telequineticos fugitivos* here', do we? We want folks to think we're normal. Or at least weird in a mundane sort of way."  
  
Lucas nodded in appreciation of the explanation, but his complaint didn't wholly dissipate. Damián watched him with a look of sly understanding.  
  
"You're right though, that's not the whole story." Damián spoke less jovially now. "I guess She hasn't given you that lesson yet." Lucas found it almost comforting to hear someone audibly pronounce the capitalization of a pronoun like that. He of course knew who Damián meant.  
  
"Once you get settled in, Vera's going to come and tell you to pick up a vocation - a fancy word for hobby - a role to play in the community - she'll use the word "encourage" but make no mistake, it's an order. She'll say -" Damián cleared his throat and put a hand on Lucas' shoulder, looking him straight in the eyes with a new intensity. "You need to make a home for yourself here. If you don't make a home for yourself, the battlefield will be here home and the war will never end for you."  
  
It was a impressively good impression. The quiet confidence with just a hint of weariness that conveyed a sagacity born out of experience. Hearing it out of Damián's mouth made Lucas shudder under the weight of his hand.  
  
"Was that close?" Damián asked and when Lucas shyly nodded, Damián grinned widely. "Good, I've been practicing." The hand withdrew from Lucas' shoulder  
  
"So everyone has a hobby then?" Lucas asked.  
  
Damián shrugged. "Most do, I suppose. Some have several. But some of us... well, we aren't so sure the war will end. Not during out lifetimes. I have some cousins who are Zapatistas. You ever hear about the Zapatistas?"  
  
Lucas shook his head.  
  
Damián clicked his tongue. "Ignorant gringos." His tone was that of friendly mocking. "Well let's just say that some struggles for freedom just keep going, I guess..." He trailed off in a shrug, his affect somber.  
  
"So you don't have a hobby then?"  
  
The question seemed to catch Damián off guard. He starred at Lucas for a moment before letting out another of his short barks of a laugh.  
  
"I never said that! I practically grew up on horseback and I take care of our horses here, been training up Andrea to help me. That's what I was doing when you arrived. Have you ever ridden a horse?" The sudden question startled Lucas. It took a moment for him to shake his head. "You want to?"  
  
The question sparked a nervous excitement that bubbled up from Lucas' stomach and let out his throat as a joyous, "Yes!"  
  
"Well let's go then!" Damián responded, laughing once more as he put an arm around Lucas' shoulders and led him away.  
  
It was not until much later, when Lucas, happily exhausted and bruised collapsed into bed - *his bed* - that he realized that he hadn't flinched from that embrace.  
  
***  
  
Vera did indeed bring up the topic of a hobby two days later. She knocked on Lucas' bedroom door one morning, just as he was about to head out. The concept of knocking thrilled Lucas. The ability to control who entered his room, to be able to say "go away", satisfied some primal need of his. Not that he had exercised this ability yet. He was still too glad that someone would want to see him - *him* - as a person instead of a Test subject.  
  
The lesson went very much as Damián had said it would, though Lucas managed to act like this was his first time hearing it. The ending took a somewhat different turn, however.  
  
"In light of your unusual circumstances, we don't expect you to find a vocation right away. Take time to experiment, settle in, find yourself."  
  
Lucas had mixed feelings about this. On one hand, he was grateful for the latitude. He really did have no clue what role he wanted to play at Emancipación, other than perhaps, that he had absolutely no talent for handling horses. On the other hand, he didn't want to be treated differently, to stand out. Ideally he would fit in to the community as soon as possible, would feel like it was *his* community.  
  
Vera seemed to read some portion of this in his expression. She took his hand and clasped it between her palms. "Do not worry, Lucas. You are home. You do have a place here."

## Chapter 6 - A Walkabout

*Thirty five years before the Proclamation*

Vera floated lazily on her back Her eyes were closed but she could feel the occasional cloud pass by, interrupting the warmth of the sun on her skin for moments or minutes at a time. She let the gentle flow bear her where it would. Her long hair fluttered unbound beneath her.

She was not asleep. To sleep here, now, would be imprudent in the extreme. But she was relaxed, relaxed to a degree she rarely permitted herself away from one of her prepared refuges. Sometimes she could allow herself a luxury like this however. And sometimes what seems like a luxury is in fact a necessity.

Even though her eyes were closed, she was aware of her surroundings. She was vigilant for ships and planes that may venture too close, forcing her to relocate. But she had chosen this spot well. Away from shore, far from the usual shipping and air travel routes, away even from the typical haunts of the fishing trawlers. All she could sense for miles in any direction were a handful of albatross and other sea birds that she couldn't name. She mentally watched as one of these birds dive low and fast, clearly about to plunge into the surf after some prey. The bird broke its descent just above the water, swooping away and beginning the long, slow spiral back upwards. Perhaps it had lost sight of its target.

This inspired Vera. She opened her eyes, basking in the late morning sun for a moment before rolling over to face downwards. Below her was several thousand feet of open air and the glistening waves of the open ocean. She breathed deep, tasting the salt even at this altitude, as she allowed the instinctual terror at the sight to pass over and through her. Nine years of this and she still hadn't shaken the natural human fear of extreme heights. But she had learned to manage it at least. After a moment, it was gone, transformed into anticipation. She grinned widely and dropped.

She fell fast, far faster than gravity alone would have insisted. With every passing moment her speed increased and the broad face of the ocean rushed towards her. The resisting air tore at her clothes and skin and hair. It stretched her cheek muscles back and caused her eyes to water. It was difficult to breathe in such a whirlwind, but Vera force herself to draw air in with large, clumsy gulps. She was more than capable of carrying a still pocket of air around her while in flight, protecting her body from the effects of excessive drag. That was certainly the safer, more comfortable way of flying. But she wasn't here today for comfort and practicality. She wanted to experience this with *all* of her senses.

And so she hurled downwards, swift and straight, like a javelin flung by some sky god of yore. The ocean surface rose up to meet here eagerly. That surface would be as hard as concrete at this speeds Vera knew. Maybe harder. At the last feasible moment, she altered her trajectory to begin leveling out, transferring her vertical momentum into horizontal. As gentle of an alteration as it was, the acceleration - the g's as a pilot would say, and what was she if not the pilot of her own body - was immense. Every muscle in Vera's body strained under the force. Her vision began closing in. And yet she could not relent, not now, lest her body break upon the waves. She was balanced on a knife's edge between two different, but equally lethal, forms of danger. Impact or unconsciousness. She was kept aloft only through the combination of practice and focus that we call skill. And Vera was loving every moment of it.

She leveled off, just barely above the rolling waves, traveling forward almost as fast as she fell. As she gradually slowed, her hand reached out to brush the water, throwing up a crest of spray behind her and abrading her fingers with the force of the impact. She began bleeding slightly but Vera didn't care. Let her blood mix with the sea. Let every living thing witness how exceedingly alive she was! A wild peal of laughter burst out of her, only to be lost in the wind. She twisted and turned as she flew forwards, the sky and sea repeatedly switching places, until she was so dizzy that she had to stop. This only made her laugh harder.

*How many people have dreamed of doing precisely this?* Vera wondered. *Thousands? Millions? Billions? Dreams of flight date back to antiquity after all. And I am the first to experience it in my waking hours?* She relished this thought, finding joy in the realization that no matter what she had lost, no matter how much had been taken from her, she still had something that no one else did. How very free she felt out here.

And yet. Even now, in the remoteness of the Pacific Ocean, she had to be careful lest she be seen. Even now, at the height of her liberatory joy, some portion of her attention was turned towards making sure that no trace of her telekinetic activities leaked out. The ward she wore was insufficient to mask such vigor. She didn't know if her pursuers would detect anything out here at sea, but she couldn't afford to find out, not with nowhere to hide on the open ocean. An aircraft bearing a suppressor machine would strand here out her, easy pickings for a boat to come retrieve her. That's if she didn't die of drowning or exposure first. How she longed to be unencumbered by such considerations. How she longed to fly, not over the open ocean, but through the canyons and mesas of her home turf in the plain light of day.

Vera continued slowing her flight until she came to a halt. Once more, she floated on her back, looking up at the cloudy sky. But now she was only a few feet above the water and the birds flew above her rather than below. She sometimes came out here for relaxation, sometimes for experimentation, and sometimes to clear her head for a major decision. This trip was in the final category. She would never experience that freedom she craved, not without some major changes to the world. And that's what she had come out here to consider.

It had been nine years since she left the mountains of New England. Nine years since her panicked, exhausted flight from normalcy. Nine years of life as an itinerant, living largely outdoors in remote sections of national forest and BLM land that was virtually unreachable on foot. In these places she would live undisturbed.  She could explore and hone her abilities. In addition to a long series of quieting charms that she had worn around her neck over those years, she had cultivated desert tree, shrub, and cactus into increasingly sophisticated wards capable of shielding even some of her more dramatic experiments from the sensors of her pursuers. 

The sun and the air had changed her as surely as the passing years. She was no longer the smooth skinned, casually athletic, still maturing girl of her college years. Nor was she the half-starved, three-quarters mad, and totally exhausted bundle of scrawny muscle and nerves that had ceaselessly hiked across Vermont and New Hampshire. Now she was toned by age and work and sun. Her skin tanned and rough. Her hair sun-bleached and frayed, long enough to reach almost to her waist when down.[^20] And yet she was clearly healthy in body and mind, well fed and intellectually active, learning new skills of agriculture, construction, and wilderness survival, even as she studied and expanded her telekinetic capabilities. Her hands were calloused and strong. Her perception heightened in ways both mundane and extrasensory. She was in her prime, she believed, and this was one factor that prompted this excursion of self-reflection. For it seemed pointless to Vera to study and train and practice forever. At some point she would need to apply the skills he had obtained. She would need to do more than survive.

[^20]:Prior to her awakening, Vera found long hair infuriating to deal with. It constantly got tangled, which she couldn't abide, and was constantly getting in her way, which was equally frustrating. While short hair was contrary to her parents' preferences, she found that she could force their hand by simply cutting her own hair with scissors. If she did a poor job of it, which was often, her parents then had no choice but to get her a proper haircut at the desired length. After her awakening, Vera found that one of the surprising benefits of telekinesis was that she was now able to keep her hair untangled and out of the way trivially. She soon grew her hair out, partly for the novelty, partly because she missed braiding Delilah's hair. Braiding her own hair was some slight reminder of the happiness she had left behind. 

***

Vera rolled over to face the water. She transitioned from floating at a constant altitude to matching the motion of the waves beneath her, not just allowing but actively causing her body to rise and fall and rise and fall as if she was floating on the actual water. It was a soothing sensation, not unlike falling asleep on a lazy afternoon. Every so often, she formed just the right angle with the sun and the water to catch a glimpse of her reflection. She had never expected to have such face, one so worn by wind and sun. There was a time when she would have found such a face ugly. Now though, she was proud of that face. It marked her as a survivor, one who had a place in the world. That was important for someone as separate from the world as she was. Then the wave would fall and her face would vanish, returned to the blue-green of the sea.

There was a doubt nagging at her, a doubt that constituted the second reason for this trip. Despite her undergraduate interest in communities, Vera had found that solitude suited her well. She used that word, "solitude", specifically. During her flight to the New England mountains, she had experienced utter, devastating loneliness, hunted and pursued with no one to turn to. Now though, she had some measure of control of her own destiny. She moved and studied and relaxed and dressed as she pleased. And she could sleep to her hearts content, a privilege that she now valued immensely. And with that stability came a comfortable acclimatization to solitude. She could spend months at a time alone in some forested canyon, venturing into town only occasionally for supplies, money from an odd job or from cheating at roulette, or the occasional proper shower in some motel room. Her interactions with other people were limited to the anonymous manner that accompanied the exchange of goods and services. She found that she barely missed her parents. She felt sorry that they didn't know what had happened to her, their only child. But she didn't crave their company. She missed Delilah certainly and perhaps some other friends as well, but this was a gentle, wistful sorrow for a path foreclosed to her, not some yawning void in her soul. Vera found that her telekinetic meditations and exercises, the books that she carried into the desert with her, and nature itself were more than enough to keep her busy. She told herself it was hard to be lonely when a short hike would introduce her to new friends in the forms of rocks and arroyos and snakes and even the occasional mountain lion. She led a contented life.

But if all this were true, why were her trips into town increasing in frequency? She used to come out of the wilderness out of necessity. Now she found herself generating the flimsiest excuses to justify a trip. She used to studiously avoid becoming a regular at any one place, lest she leave any clues for a diligent pursuer. But then she had started lingering in those restaurants and bookstores and casinos far longer than needed. She would remain, listening to the chatter and gossip and conversations of ordinary lives that were anything but ordinary to her. Not only was she soon making such trips more frequently, she was spending more time in the same venues than was prudent. At some point in the past few months, she had realized she was now a regular at a couple of diners, staying long after her plate was empty so she could watch and listen and even chat with the employees and other customers. She knew their names now. For the more talkative ones, she knew much of their life stories and current concerns. 

There was the waitress Samantha, who, contrary to the all the stories, seemed genuinely content working at a restaurant in a small town that she and her parents and grandparents had all grown up in. Her biggest problem was that her parents kept pressuring her to settle down with some man or another to have kids, which, in Sam's eyes, would only disturb her present contentment.

There was Jimi, the owner of a small ranch that he had bought himself decades ago, whose wife was dead and whose children were grown and moved on to the same city that Jimi had fled as soon as he could. He came to the Coffeepot out of loneliness, for the simple pleasure of familiar faces and friendly eyes.

And there were others. They all knew Vera's name too, her rather her alias, Kel.[^18] They also knew some bare bones of her background. Vera avoided lying through vagueness and deflection, her favorite tactic being returning the topic of conversation towards the inquirer. Even this was dangerous, Vera knew. In former years even a single such interaction would have been enough to send her on to some new place to hide out for a while. And yet, she had kept returning despite herself.

[^18]: She had chosen the name, Kelly "Kel" Smith, to be generic and forgettable. At the first of these, it was largely successful, as there were at least several hundred Kelly Smiths in the US at that time, more than enough to make any online search for *this* Kelly Smith all but impossible. In the latter however, it proved lacking, judging by the lasting relations that Vera formed despite her attempts at maintaining a low profile. Samantha Miller would, in fact, remember Vera Kelly when the Proclamation hit the news a full thirty-five years later. Also worth noting here that the use of this alias was perhaps the closest that Vera came to outright lying in response to a direct question. Later Vera would defend this act of pseudo-mendacity on the grounds that as her last name was Kelly, Kel was a perfectly legitimate nickname and thus not actually a lie at all. Furthermore, her mother's maiden name was Smith and only a bureaucratic error left it off Vera's birth certificate as a middle name. The facts that precisely no one had called her Kel prior to this and that reordering names does constitute a different full name, she brushed off as mere semantics. To be clear, her justification was offered unprompted and likely directed primarily at herself. In fact, those who were told of this story almost uniformly expressed surprise that Vera hadn't used a properly false name, particularly considering the many other, much more extreme measures that she took to remain hidden from the HDU.

Then there were the poker games. For the past year now, Vera had been a regular on the irregular poker scene across the Southwest US and northern Mexico. She had learned to play the game as a child, taught by some relative at some family reunion, but she only came to enjoy it more recently, when using the game as a cover. While Vera made a good potion of her money in those days at the roulette table, she was cognizant of the fact that a young woman who came in, won big at roulette, and departed could easily became the stuff of rumors in the folklore-heavy gambling community, no matter how she tried to spread it out across venues. And so she would intermix rounds of roulette with games that she did not cheat at (blackjack, slots, and poker most commonly). Some days she would intentionally play enough of these to actually lose money, only to return later and win more than she lost. Over time, however, it turned out that Vera had quite a decent head for probabilities (which she would maintain constituted the bulk of poker), an acute ability to read her opponents (even without resorting to extrasensory perception of their physiology), and a startling good poker face. 

The last of these learned her an invite to a private game that, to her surprise, she accepted. In the words of Victor, the middle-aged man with a handle-bar mustache and a black leather jacket who had approached her with the invite after a particularly successful game: "Ma'am, sitting across from you, well it's like you're peering into a man's soul. Something uncanny about it. I'd love to see you try that trick on some folks who actually know how to play."

Now here she was, a year later, playing games at ranches and barns and private clubs on both sides of the border, with men and women that she never thought that she would associate with. And who she increasingly thought of as friends, even though there wasn't one among them who wouldn't think twice about taking everything she had, given the chance. It was through these games that she had come into the possession of two different deeds. One, an empty hundred acres of southern Arizona; the other, a mission turned ranch turned abandoned property in the mountains of the Bajío down in Mexico. She had visited both, more to confirm they existed than anything, but hell if she knew what she would do with them.

***

This recollection brought a wry smile to Vera's face Her back was beginning to grow quite hot in the direct midday sunlight. She breathed in and allowed herself to fall the last few feet into the ocean waves. The cold water of the Pacific poured over her, filling her senses and causing her muscles to tense. She reveled in the shock and forced herself to swim underwater a few body lengths before surfacing with a gasp. She resumed swimming, at the surface now, freestyle with her own arms and legs, no telekinetic assistance. She may not have been making any progress against the wind and the waves. She didn't care. That wasn't the point. As much as Vera loved her telekinesis, as much as it had become an integral part of her over the past nine years, she still loved to use her own muscles, feeling the pleasure of exertion and strain. 

So, was she truly happy with a life of solitude? Or did she need more? And if so, would she be contented with these pseudo-friendships, with these pale shadows of genuine relationships, with people she could share precious little, not even her own name? Could she hide her telekinesis from even those closest to her? Was she prepared to let Vera Kelly die so that someone else could live in her place?

Vera redoubled her swimming intensity, putting all her strength into each furious stroke and each kick. Between every other stroke, she gulped down air, tasting the brine. Here eyes were clamped shut but the seawater still found its way in, the salt causing her eyes to string. She didn't mind. All of this was vivid proof of her living defiance those who would capture her. 

Which brought her to the third reason for today, the most proximate one, the one she was finding hardest to live with.

Five weeks ago, she had woken in the middle of the night with a sudden start. She was staying at one of her favorite spots: a shaded hollow in the side of a canyon deep inside the Coconino National Forest of northern Arizona. No trails passed nearby and it was virtually impossible to reach without a day's hike and plenty of climbing gear. Unless you had Vera's powers, that is. It was also well hidden by stone and trees from aerial photographers, reducing the already slim chance that some Department of Interior surveyor would notice her by accident. This was one of the first places she had made her home since escaping from the Northeast and it indeed felt like home, like a peaceful refuge where she was safe from the world. She had never once been disturbed while staying there.

Which was why the experience of being shaken awake was even more disturbing. It was a violation of the sanctity of that place. She sat bolt upright in her sleeping bag, surprise and adrenaline doing their best to clear the cobwebs of sleep from her mind. Still it took her several long seconds to realize that she had not, in fact, been physically shaken awake. There was no one else in her tent or even nearby. The nearest creature of any size was a desert hare in its hole some twenty yards off. The sensation she had felt, that she was still feeling, was the use of telekinetic fumbling by someone like her. No, not like her. Like a complete novice. Like who she had once been. Not too far off either. Less than a hundred miles, to be sure. South of here. In Phoenix, maybe, if not closer.

It took several more long seconds for this realization to sink in. Once it did, Vera was suddenly out of her sleeping bag and scrambling to get dressed. In a matter of moments[^19], Vera was hurtling through the woods, faster than was humanely possible, towards where she had left her car, a beat up Honda Civic of dubious provenance. It wasn't logged as stolen in any database at least. And it had enough gas in the tank for a rather swift hundred mile drive.

[^19]: Telekinesis can enable one to get dressed and packed impressively quickly, but only if one practices for it. Vera Kelly would never let members of the Sodality forget their precarious and hunted status. One of the first practical telekinetic lessons she would teach to novitiates was how to dress oneself quickly. And one of the first mundane lessons she taught was what to put in a go-bag. Most members of the Sodality continued to practice both even many years after the Proclamation and go-bags were a distinct feature of virtually any telekinetic's bedroom.

Vera made swift progress on the minimally trafficked roads leading down and out of the mountains. Before long she found herself facing a suburban home in Scottsdale. More precisely, she was on the roof of the opposing house, carefully peaking over the ridge line, her awareness lightly draped over the neighborhood. There was one light on int the house, on the second floor. In that room was a young man enthralled and bewildered by what was happening to him. Evidently his parents were heavy sleepers as they did not stir even as he clumsily moved furniture around his bedroom and repeatedly dropped objects due to a lack of focus and control.

Vera had to fight the urge to drop off the roof, cross the street and float up through his window. She didn't know how long it would take for the Pursuers to arrive, but she had an opportunity, right here and now, to rescue this familiar stranger. She was on the verge of doing precisely that when another voice spoke up within her. 

*How would he react to me, a complete a stranger, slipping into his second story window?* Even if, by some miracle, he didn't scream and wake his parents, what would she tell him? That mysterious men in masks were coming to kidnap him and never let him return? 

"And why would they do this?" She imagined him asking.

"Don't know."

"What will they do with me?"

"No clue, but instead you should come with *this* mysterious *unmasked* woman and never return to your family. But with me it will be, you know, voluntarily, for their protection and yours."

"And where would you take me?"

"Well, I'm an itinerant who lives mostly outdoors."

"So you're homeless."

"No, not exactly, I could live indoors if I wanted to. I have plenty of money from cheating at casinos."

"Oh good, so you're homeless and a thief." 

The simulated conversation only went downhill from there. Vera considered taking the young man by force. It would be easily enough, but would this not just further eliminate the distinctions between her and the Pursuers? Would he ever trust her after that? Would he ever be willing to live in isolation with her?

Vera was still considering all these questions when the all too familiar set of vans and SUVs quietly filled the adjacent suburban streets still well before dawn. She immediately withdrew her extrasensory awareness from the neighborhood, lest she be detected. Hopefully any signal they had picked up from her would just be attributed to the novice. This had been a rare instance of indecision in the face of crisis for Vera, and it had cost her this opportunity.

Now she was forced to lie still and watch helplessly as the suppressor machines were turned on. For the first time in almost nine years, she was confined to her own mortal frame.  She had to watch helplessly as the squad crept into the house. The parents may have been sound sleepers but evidently the household dog was not. Angry barking split the night. A few moments later, it was silenced by a muffled gunshot. Perhaps that was enough to rouse the parents, as soon there were two additional gunshots. At almost the same time, a hooded and bound figure was roughly hauled out of the house and thrown in the back of a van. By the time the neighbors had roused and began calling 911, the dark street was empty once more.

Tears filled Vera's eyes. She sobbed quietly on the roof. Whether it was out of sorrow for what she had just witnessed, regret at her own inaction, or the relived trauma of seeing what had almost happened to her, she wasn't sure. 

Soon enough, the suppressor machines were either turned off or out of range. Vera's powers returned, though she pointedly did not use them to peer inside the now empty house before her. Instead she quietly slipped off the roof and back to her car a couple of blocks away. She may have failed to prevent this tragedy, but she could still follow her pursuers and maybe learn a bit more about them.

Ultimately Vera would learn precious little. The captive was taken to a nearby military base and brought into a building that had suppressor machines constantly running. The next morning, a different vehicle, also equipped with a suppressor machine, left the building and was loaded onto a military aircraft that flew off to the northeast. Vera could not risk flying during the daytime, so could only track it from where she stood. It had gone perhaps fifty miles when she lost track of it. Tracking the absence of something, caused by the suppressor machines, was distinctly more difficult than tracking the presence of something. This was enough to confirm Vera's suspicions that her Pursuers were somehow affiliated with the US government. In an effort to gather more information, she also picked someone to follow at random from among those who exited the same building. By all appearances, he was an ordinary soldier who worked on that same military base. He did not return to that building for the several weeks that Vera monitored him before giving up.

***

Vera might have been able to excuse her inaction if this was the first such occurrence. It was not. 

Five years earlier, she had felt a similar telekinetic signal, this one much weaker, originating a few hundred miles away from where she had been staying at the time. It was this prior experience that caused her to recognize the Scottsdale signal as quickly as she did. During this first occurrence, it had taken her nearly twenty minutes to puzzle out what she was feeling. 

The end result was similar though. Vera had flown swiftly through the cover of night, as the source of the signal was too distant to reach by car in time. Even so, by the time she had alighted in Fresno, California, the signal was gone. Vera was able to identify the convoy of vehicles speeding away on a nearby highway, however, including a centrally placed void that to her telekinetic sight was the trademark of an active suppressor machine.

It was this event that had confirmed for Vera that she was not alone, no mere singular freak of nature. She had been confident of this already, after all, her Pursuers had been organized and ready prior to her awakening, but this was concrete, direct evidence. There were others like her.

This event should have prompted Vera to be ready for the next time. And yet she hadn't been.

So here she was, desperately paddling in the ocean, as if by swimming as fast as possible, her strokes could carry her away from her failure. This was impossible, of course. Eventually, exhausted, Vera drifted to a halt. She rolled onto her back, gasping for breath as she rose and fell with the waves. Salt stung her eyes, though whether it was from sea or sweat or tears, Vera could not tell.

If -- *when* -- another telekinetic appeared, Vera needed to be ready for more than silently watching. And yet, the same concerns that had stayed her hand previously still held true. She had to find a way to persuade a young, scared individually in a timely fashion. And then what? Would they be able to live a life like hers? Here she was, having doubts about her own acclimatization to solitude and isolation. What were the odds that some random other person would be even somewhat similarly inclined?

But maybe there being two of them would change things. And if the pace of new awakenings, continued as it had been, it might only be a few years before a third joined them. In time, they could have a community. A memory of the abandoned ranch crept into Vera's mind. *Perhaps. Worth a try.*

That still left how to persuade her would-be comrade to come and to remain hidden for years, maybe decades to come. She needed to be able to answer at least some of their questions. Hell, she needed those answers herself. How to get them?

Vera thought back to Scottsdale and Fresno, to her own awakening, searching for any threads to pull. And there was one connection, one person who could provide her some answers. She just had to persuade him.

Vera rose out of the surf and shook herself, sending droplets flying off into the rollers. She oriented herself and began flying towards the coast. this excursion was over. She had a plan. Or the beginnings of one. The next time she felt a telekinetic awaken, Vera would be ready to do more than stand by.


## Chapter 7 - An Accusation

*Three years before the Proclamation*

By the time Vera entered the dining hall, most of the Sodality was already assembled. Over the past few weeks, she had already met each person as they had returned from the Sodality's far-flung outposts, but in the increasing bustle of a full Emancipación, not everyone had yet had the same opportunity. Old friends were greeting each other with the particular kind of glad exclamations and firm embraces characteristic of the cessation of long separations. Introductions were being made between the novitiates and the returners. In short, a family reunion.

Vera remained near the kitchen door, not exactly hidden but not easily noticed either, engaged as they were in the friendly chatter of a close-knit community. Though all surely knew the reason for the gathering, its weight had yet to settle on their souls and Vera didn't want to disturb the moment. She quietly looked over the crowd. The hall consisted of three long tables wit bench seats. On one end was a counter that separated that hall from the kitchen and on which communal meals were served. Some two dozen people were in the hall already, some seated, some standing, with more coming in every minute.

Her heart filled with a tumultuous mix of love and fear. Love for these people and the community they had built. Love for these people and the community they had built. Love for her friends, her family, her children. Love for their voices and laughter and presence. Fear for what they may decide here today. Fear for what that decision may do to their community. Fear that the coming war may take them from here, may render this place into dust and bone.

So she hesitated to break the calm and instead savored this moment of peace.

But before she could bring herself to act, the calm was broken anyways. A pair of voices raised in anger entered the hall from just outside the main entrance. The specific words were muddled by some combination of walls, distance, and Vera's age, but the tone of vociferous disagreement was clear. Vera recognized the voices at once, even if she hadn't been already monitoring their approach to the hall.

*Of course they couldn't wait until the meeting to start arguing.*

She was just about to deliver a psychic rebuke when Xinyue, already seated near one end of the central table next to Roseanne, beat her to it. *If you're going to fight over this, you might as well come inside so we can discuss this properly. Together.* It was possible to send such messages discreetly, but Xinyue had chosen to broadcast it openly.

The conversation in the hall ceased at once, as did the angry voices. A mix of arched eyebrows, half-hidden smiles, and uncomfortable grimaces rippled across the crowd, as those that were still standing swiftly sought out seats. A moment later, an indignant Ezekiel strode in, followed shortly be a sheepish Arsène. They both looked around for a moment, then made their way to two of the few remaining seats, coincidentally located on opposite sides of the hall.

Vera recognized that she couldn't stall any longer. She walked across the room and along the long tables and crowded benches. The Sodality had been growing rapidly these past few years and it had been years since all of them had been in one place together. The dining hall had been expanded twice now and was apparently due for a third renovation soon. *That or future conclaves will need out to the amphitheater moving forward, regardless of the weather.* This thought made Vera internally laugh at herself. *Even now in the face of such a dramatic change, my mind turns towards the mundane details of community planning.*

She passed by Rosanne, the sleeping infant Christian on her lap, the fourth and youngest child born to the Sodality, before taking the seat on Xinyue's far side that had been left open for her.

"Thank y'all for coming. It does my heart good to see us gathered together, to see to many of us here." Vera spoke confidently but at a normal volume. One of the virtues of speaking to telekinetics was that there was little need of amplification or even direct line of sight to a speaker. "We have grown over the past few years, both with new recruits and new children. Though some of us now live across oceans, we all have a home here. We have built something wonderful. I saw that to remind us, during the today's discussion, that we have more than personal survival or abstract ideals to protect. We have something real, something tangible. We have each other."

A psychic trill of agreement and affection echoed around the room.

"First, I know we are still three months off from our usual annual meeting, but I want to formally introduce the two new novitiates. If we get a third in the next few months, that will be a new record. Anyways, please welcome Andrea Morales of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua and Lucas Hayward of Waukesha, Wisconsin." Both stood, Andrea proudly and Lucas sheepishly, as clapping and cheers filled the room. Eventually the room quieted and both sat back down.

Vera took a breath. "I will lay out the new facts and then turn things over for us to discuss our course of action." She described Lucas' history and rescue plainly, allowing the audience to react to the description of the torture he endured as they would. None questioned or even raised an eyebrow at Vera's decision to bring Lucas here, despite the mission he had been sent on. Why would they? He was a telekinetic like them. It was as simple as that.

What to do next wasn't so simple. As soon as Vera concluded and opened the floor for discussion, half a dozen arms shot up. To her surprise, Ezekiel was not one of them. Xinyue, smoothly sliding into the role of moderator, recognized the fastest hand among the bunch, Arsène, who immediately stood to speak, even though this wasn't necessary.

"Since it seems like pretty much everyone heard E's and my... enthusiastic discussion earlier," a light laughter rippled across the room. Ezekiel laughed harder than most, with no hint on ingenuousness. "Maybe we should get that out in the open. As we saw it, there are actually two questions before us right now. The first is, is now the time take action against the HDU, to free those held captive like our brother here, and to take the first concrete steps towards a world where we may walk freely. On this question, E and I are in emphatic agreement that the answer is yes." 

Ezekiel nodded in confirmation. Vera now saw why he had not leapt to speak first. As strongly as Ezekiel felt about this matter, he valued the consensus of the community. That would be easier if they started with the points on which there was agreement. 

Arsène continued, "The second question is what specific steps we should take, what tactics we should employ, and, in particular, what level of force and violence are we willing to use. On this question, E and I disagree. I propose that we collectively tackle the first question first." Arsène sat back down.

There was no real disagreement on this point. Up until now, it had been easy to maintain the status quo, to push off the day of their uprising a few more years down the line. They would have more recruits, more safehouses, be better prepared. That stance was harder to maintain when there was a living, breathing HDU captive in the room. So while there were various attempts at considering the issue from all sides or playing devil's advocate, the outcome of this initial discussion was all but certain. The best attempt came from head gardener, Julian.

"There is the subtle, patient option. At the rate we're establishing safehouses, we'll have the entire world covered in, what, twenty years? Twenty five? Thus far, we've only missed one awakening in a region with an established safehouse."

Vera noted Antonio's lips thin at this reminder of his mistake three years ago.

"If we are reacting to each awakening faster than the HDU, we've won," Julian continued. "They won't have anyone else to kidnap. Then we can fight them or not, reveal ourselves or not, on our own schedule, on our own terms. It's not without risk, of course, but certainly it is lower risk than going to war or publicly protesting. Am I missing something?"

"Sixty three." Antonio's voice held a mix frustration and guilt.

"Sixty three?" Xinyue of course knew the answer. They likely all did. But she wanted to force him to be clear.

"Sixty three more captives. That's how many more awakenings we would expect to miss following that plan. I collected the data on frequencies of awakenings, on global population density, and on our safe house deployment schedules. I put together some statistical simulations. If current trends continue, you're missing sixty three more Lucas'. Plus or minus five."[^26]


[^26]: It is perhaps worth noting that the estimate of sixty three captives (which retrospective analysis would largely bear out) does not represent sixty three recruits to the Sodality. Even after our recruitment methods were refined, approximately one in three novitiates declined to come with their rescuer. This was only to be expected and the proper procedure was to provide them with a quieting charm, help them evade identification by the HDU or local equivalent, and then teach them how to remain discreet over the following weeks, enabling them to continue to live ordinary lives. The regional safehouse tended to remain in contact with such individuals and usually, but not always, in the following months, the novitiate would be driven by curiosity over their powers to seek a more complete induction at Emancipación.

A long silence followed and that had been the end of discussion on that topic. Xinyue called for a vote to be sure and it was unanimous. The Sodality would be taking action against the HDU.

Ezekiel was the first to speak in the second portion of the discussion. Like Arsène, he rose to speak. 

"We have hidden in the shadows for too long already. We've allowed too many brothers and sisters whose names we didn't even know be stolen from us. We've grown in numbers and strength. We've been training for this. We are ready to act. We know who the enemy are. We know where they are. We need only reach out and crush them. We know what one of us alone can accomplish against them, even with their damned suppressors. We have nothing but own fear of losing holding us back."

The subsequent silence was precariously tense, on the verge of snapping. Everyone could feel it just as they recognized the clear insult Ezekiel had directed at Vera. She herself was surprised, not that he would do such a thing (Ezekiel had made no secret of his disagreement with her on this topic) but that he would do it so quickly, before she or Arsène or any contrary voice rose to speak. Regardless of the timing, she was prepared to respond.

"I'm not afraid of losing. I am afraid of winning. I'm afraid that we if repeat my mistake, we'll end up no better than those we fight against."

## Chapter 8 - A Downfall

*Thirty two years before the Proclamation*

Josh struggled awake, fighting through aches all over his body. It took time to resolve the general sensation of pain into specific sources. It took even longer to piece together his situation.

A raging headache. A parched throat. Wrists aching and chaffed from the plastic ties binding them together. Straining shoulders arching backwards towards his bound hands. What was he bound to? A metal chair. Nondescript. Where was he? A room. An old one. Plain, worn, unfinished wooden floor. The walls were made of... adobe? No windows that he could see, but maybe behind him? Another metal chair sitting empty in a corner. The room was lit by an exposed lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. 

How had he ended up here? Where had he been? It took effort to recall through the aches and confusion, but he could slowly feel his mind clearing. An eruption intervention. Near Salt Lake City. He was leading the extraction team. They had been forming a perimeter when... something hit him? Pulled him? It had been fast, too fast for him to see? And too strong to struggle against. Then the darkness of a hood and he was bound. A long period of jostling and noise and discomfort. Then here.

He had been kidnapped, clearly. Why? How? By whom? Surely not the eruption. How would it have known they were coming? And the whole point of an eruption intervention was getting there fast, before it really learned to use its abilities. So then, someone else interested in the eruption? But who?

*Damn, this headache is killing me.* This HDU gig was supposed to be a cushy side gig. Extra pay, serve your country, minimal effort. Mostly some periodic trainings and simulations. Josh had only been called up for an eruption on three occasions in his twenty years on the job. Four if you counted the one that landed him here. His full time job at the DEA had always seemed riskier. You never knew what some coke fiend or tweaker was going to do when law enforcement rolled in.

*Maybe that was it!* Maybe this had nothing to do with an eruption at all. Some cartel thugs had followed him and grabbed him. That would fit the architecture here. It was a bold move, going after a fed, but not unheard of. Now who specifically would have --

Josh realized that he should be spending less time figuring out who did this and more time working on an escape. He wobbled his chair a bit, testing his range of motion. He could hop around if he put effort into it. Maybe if he threw himself on the floor he could-- 

But then he heard footsteps creaking on the ancient floor. *Fuck, I missed my chance!* He could only hope another opportunity would come his way. He could hear a wooden bar being lifted from the other side of the door. Josh closed his eyes and went limp, or as limp as his binds would allow. The door creaked open.

"Come now. Let's not play such games. I know you're awake." The voice was gentle, relaxed. The feminine tone and accent surprised Josh. He opened his eyes and saw a woman of indeterminate age before him. A white woman, he thought, though the wear of sun and wind on her skin gave her a somewhat ambiguous appearance. He began doubting his cartel theory, though did not discard it altogether yet. The woman was dressed plainly: a dark green, button-up hiking shirt and jeans. There was no malice in her face but her eyes held steely purpose. Her gaze seemed to trap him more surely than his fetters. He looked away, more to escape that gaze than to investigate further, but he noticed that she held a glass full of a clear liquid. 

His captor followed his line of sight. "It's water," she said. "For you, if you want it."

*Ah, so that's what this was.* Josh had received training on how to endure interrogation back during his days as a Green Beret. He waited for her to attach some condition to the drink, something minor,  intended to gently guide him over the the threshold to cooperation. To this surprise, however, she silently stepped forward and extended the glass.

"Well?" She asked like she was hosting a house guest not a captive. Josh warily nodded and allowed her to pour some water into his mouth. It was warm and tasted of metal but that hardly mattered to him. He gulped it down over the fire of his parched throat, then quickly accepted another sip. Before long, the entire glass was empty. *First one is free, but you'll have to pay for the second.* No doubt that was her strategy.

The woman stepped away to retrieve the second chair. She placed it before Josh and sat, neatly placing both hands in her lap around the now empty glass. She looked Josh up and down with an evaluating gaze, saying nothing. Josh remained silent. Let her tip her hand first.

"Do you know who I am?" This is not the question Josh was expecting. Was this some kind of joke? A taunt? But the women's voice held no hint of mockery and her posture communicated polite curiosity. Josh studied her again, mentally combing through all the files on cartel associates his unit was investigating. The women waited patiently. When his expression transitioned from appraisal to befuddlement, she spoke again.

"It's been a long time." Her voice was quiet now. Hardly more than a whisper, with a hint of sadness or regret in it. "More than ten years. I was still in college."

This confused him even more. Then years ago, he wasn't on the Latin American cartel beat at all. He had been in New England, investigating the European smugglers. What college girl had he interacted with at then? 

Then he saw it. The girl coming flying over the fence, right at him, a scooter in hand. An impact to his chest like being sacked by a lineman. The recognition hit him nearly as hard. If the chair had been any lighter, he might have gone tumbling over onto the floor with the force of his startlement. He had spoken her name aloud before he realized what he was doing: "Vera Kelly."

Vera nodded slowly, seeming unperturbed by his reaction or his subsequent alarmed stare. She waited for him to regain some degree of possession of himself before proceeding.

"I'm not here -- you're not here -- for revenge."

This did little to comfort Josh. 

"I am here for information," she continued. So this was an interrogation! And by one of *them*! At this moment, Josh realized how well and truly fucked he was. He wasn't escaping and he was in for a hellish time before he died. All he could hope to do was lead this monster astray.

Vera proceeded, "Here's what is going to happen. I am going to ask questions. You are going to answer them. Honestly. Some of the question that I am going to ask, I already know the answers to. For example, you were in Fresno eight years ago. And you weren't at Scottsdale three years ago. Do you understand?" 

Josh's eyes widened in alarm. Vera had been watching the eruption interventions! And she had recognized him, him specifically, under the mask and gear. This realization delayed his consideration of the question. But then he saw it, the thinly veiled threat. It was a common interrogation technique, though not always stated so plainly to the prisoner. If he lied, she might know, and if she knew... Josh nodded and said, "I do."

Vera responded with one short nod of her own. Her face was unreadable. "You already know what I am. You have some idea of what I am capable of. Do you understand?" He definitely did, though his mind refused to consider the more lurid details of what Vera - *the Vera Kelly* -  could do to him without raising a hand. He nodded again, sullenly silent this time.

His captor seemed satisfied with this response. There's one other thing," her voice rose slightly now and her enunciation became crisp, as if this point was particularly important. "I have every intention of returning you to your life unharmed when we are done here." 

*First the stick and now the carrot*.  Josh doubted her sincerity. Releasing him would provide invaluable information to the HDU, who weren't even sure she was still alive at this point. No, Josh expected to die here. It was just a matter of how much he would go through first. He chose not to react to her words and offered no acknowledgement. 

After a long silence, Vera continued, "We can begin then. Let's start with the name of the organization you work for."

"HDU. The Homeland Defense Unit." Josh didn't even consider snidely answering that he worked for the DEA. There was no point in antagonizing his captor over something so trivial. Besides, the name of the agency wouldn't help her, not in any meaningful sense. 

"And your name?'"

"Josh-- Joshua Daniels." Simple enough. Nothing to endanger operational security yet. Besides, she apparently already knew who he was. But would he be up for dissembling when they got to the meaningful stuff? He wasn't sure.

"How long have you worked at the HDU, Josh?" She was using his name to try and build a rapport, he knew.

"Twenty two years."

"What do you do with the people that you capture?" The abrupt change from the mundane to important was intended to catch him off guard. It wouldn't work. Josh decided to risk a lie here.

"The extraction team captures them, kills them, and then disposes of the body."

Instantly, he realized that he had misstepped. Vera hardly moved. Perhaps her grip on the glass tightened slightly. Perhaps her lips thinned minutely. But her eyes no longer held focused curiosity. Now they held... disappointment? Josh braced himself for what was to come.

"I thought we understood each other." Her tone was as gentle as before. "Perhaps your imagination is insufficient." Josh bristled at this insult, but fear restrained him. "Perhaps you do not realize what I am capable of. I am not the novice who clumsily threw you across a yard, Joshua! I have stayed hidden from you for more than a decade. Did you even consider that I might have learned something in that time?"

Only now did Josh realize the magnitude of his error. He had earlier refused to imagine what Vera could do to him. Now he could think of nothing else.

"I am capable of great deal more precision and creativity now." As Vera spoke, Josh felt a grip on his left index finger, locking it in place. Then he felt a tensile force on his nail, slowly building, threatening to pull the nail off. Josh started writhing, trying to escape the unnerving, invisible, implacable force, but there was nowhere to go. Just before the force on his nail escalated past frightening discomfort to pain, however, it released. Josh had only a moment's relief before it started all over again on the adjacent finger. As Vera continued in this way, one finger after another, Josh began experiencing suite of similarly terrifying sensations simultaneously. A finger running down the inside of his throat. He elbow joints pulling apart. A pressure in his head that distorted his vision. Tension on individual hairs all over his body. None of it was intense enough to hurt. These were threats, whispered promises, not the thing itself.

By the time the demonstration was over. Josh was exhausted from terror. Sweat drenched his clothes and stung his eyes. His wrists and ankles were raw and bleeding from straining against his fetters. 

During all of this, Vera had not moved an inch. Her eyes had remained locked on his. When Vera repeated her question as if nothing had happened, Josh answered honestly.

"They are restrained and shipped off to HDU headquarters, at Fort Meade. The intervention team hands them off to some scientists there. I don't know what specifically happens to them in there, but they don't leave, at least not alive."

Vera proceeded to her next question. She asked about the HDU recruitment methods, the intervention process, how invention agents were trained and briefed, how the HDU was connected to the rest of the federal government. Josh answered all honestly, even volunteering information occasionally to demonstrate his cooperation. After what seemed like hours, but could have been as short as thirty minutes, Vera declared that they were done for the day. She pulled out a black hood which she placed over his head and lifted him, chair and all, with invisible hands. When she removed the blindfold once more, Josh found himself in a similar room, but with a great deal more furnishing. A bed, a sink, a small table with food on it.

"There's a bedpan under the bed." Vera said. "I will empty it once a day." And then Josh felt the fetters on his arm and legs snap and fall to the ground. By the time he managed to stand, Vera was gone, the door barred behind her.

***

Over the following days, Vera continued her questioning of Joshua, though never for more than an hour at a time. He covered a wide range of topics, only some of which dealt directly with the HDU. She asked her captive about his life, his family, his aspirations. When she did ask about the HDU, Josh only sometimes had meaningful answers to provide, such was the secrecy of the organization. He did not know how the suppressor machines functioned, for instance, much less how Vera's powers worked or where they came from. He knew that people like Vera sprung up all over the world and that other organizations handled those that were outside of HDU's North American jurisdiction, but he knew precious little about where those sister agencies were based, how they were affiliated, or even what they were called.

Vera would often retread ground previously covered, perhaps to check for consistency (though he never saw her taking notes) or perhaps to simply further disorient him. Never again did Joshua try to lie or deflect though. He despised his cowardice but could not overcome it. Every time Vera transported him from the bedroom to the interrogation cell, he was reminded of just what she could do to him. He suspected this was precisely why she moved him back and forth in this way, rather than just questioning him in the same room that he slept. 

When he wasn't being questioned, Joshua ate, slept, did some calisthenics, and stared at the wall. Over time, in some twisted way, he even came to look forward to the interrogation sessions, his only break from the monotony of captivity. He was sure that this was intentional. Perhaps that was why he occasionally found himself believing Vera's promise to let him go after she was done with her questions. And perhaps that was just desperation. 

And so days stretched into weeks.

***

Vera sat at a rough-hewn wooden table in what had once been the kitchen of this dilapidated ranch. She was looking out the empty window frame at a tall adobe structure across the way -- the old bell tower of the mission, she thought -- and beyond it to the mountains that surrounded this valley. Both of her elbows rested on the table. A mostly empty glass of well water lazily floated through the air back and forth between her hands. Half a dozen flies buzzed around her but found themselves unable to actually land on her skin. They kept trying, again and again, unable to comprehend what force repeatedly confounded them.

Vera felt disgusted with herself. She had thought that, between her long solitude and her deep bitterness towards her pursuers -- towards the HDU, she finally had a name for them -- she would be able to consider Josh callously, even cruelly. But now she called him "Josh" even in her own head. Not "Agent Davis." Not "my captive." Not "my hated enemy." Part of why she had picked Josh out of the intervention team was precisely because he had been present at her own awakening. She had recognized him by the distinctive scar that ran down his left arm. He, not just the HDU generally, but *he specifically* had tried to kidnap and kill her that day. It should be easy for her to hate him, to hold him responsible for all of this. But she just couldn't. 

She didn't feel justified or resolute or angry. She just felt disgusted at the torture that she was inflicting. And it was torture, she help no pretenses about that. She hadn't physically hurt Josh and she wasn't going to, even if he were to defy her, though she had let him believe otherwise. But that threat itself, along with all of this isolation and captivity, was itself a potent form of psychological torture. 

Vera tried to justify this by necessity. She had learned a great deal from this endeavor beyond the name of her pursuers. She knew where they were based and how they operated. She even had some sense of their motivations. Most critically of all, she knew who she needed to persuade if she was ever to put an end to this and had some idea of how to go about that persuasion. Josh had revealed that HDU had not publicized their failure to capture her, even within the organization. Josh only knew who she was because he had been part of the team tasked with capturing her that day so many years ago. And he had been instructed to not discuss her escape with anyone. That was important. It suggested that HDU might be sensitive to escalation.

And Vera couldn't see any other way that she could have obtained this intelligence.

She had needed that information to decide on what her next steps would be. This was the only reasonable way to get it. *Reasonable? Was torture ever reasonable?*

She remotely checked in on Josh. He was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. During his first several days here, he would be exercising at this time. But he was becoming increasingly lethargic. Despondent. Shame filled Vera. This had gone on long enough. She still had questions, but none that were worth prolonging this. Vera grabbed the glass out of the air and gulped down the rest of its contents. She sighed and stood up. Time to put an end to this farce.

Turning away from the table, she strode over towards the storage room turned prison cell. She would tell Josh that the questioning was over, that she would redeem her promise to him, that he only needed to wait a few more days for her to prepare her next steps. She was thinking it was time a formal statement to the HDU. A declaration of intent.

***

Vera stood on the sun-baked roof of the Nevada data center, reveling in her power. As worn out as she was by her exertions these past few days, it felt exquisitely good to be exercising her powers so freely at last. She wore no suppression charm and made no attempt to hide her activities, to hide herself. Let the HDU come. She wanted them to come. She wasn't some frightened and confused novice anymore, no naïve college student. She wasn't fleeing from vans and men in masks. Not today. Today they would come at her invitation, to the ground prepared by her.

A significant portion of her attention was dedicated to maintaining the trap. She hoped that no one would have to die this day but she did want them to see what she was capable of, see the severity of their mistake in failing to capture her a decade ago, see the need to negotiate some kind of settlement now. She tried to tell herself that if anyone died today, it would be the HDU's fault, not hers. But such self-justification rang false even to her. The HDU were the aggressors to be sure, the ones who had set in motion this war that they did not see coming. But she was the one who brought this day into being. She was the one who had a trussed up hostage waiting below, the one who laid out the warning signs, the one who made the skeleton staff of this data center flee in terror, the one who prepared her trap. The responsibility for today was hers. The thought both thrilled and terrified her.

But she tried not to think to much about that. Instead she focused on her maintenance, on watching for the appearance of the HDU, on enjoying operating so openly for once. The desert sun was amplified by the reflectivity of the long building's concrete, drenching her in sweat, but she didn't mind it one bit. Besides, the dry air quickly swept it away. Vera took a swig from the water bottle clipped to her waist and took pleasure in the act. The anticipation made her feel so vividly alive, added zest to each mundane experience, and helped to distract her from any lingering moral qualms.

At last she felt the approach of a convoy of vehicles to this remote facility. Mostly HDU, though some federal law enforcement accompanied them. *Fine. Let them witness too.*

She turned and walked back inside to wait for her guests to arrive. 

***

It took several minutes for the HDU to arrive and set up their perimeter. Vera took the opportunity to do one last round of checks.

She stood in the massive main server room, near the center of the building, amid the hum of computers and cooling systems. The remaining sweat on her clothes was evaporating in the air conditioned space. She had a desk placed before her. On it were some monitors showing live feeds from security cameras across the facility, both interior and exterior. All operating as expected. She pressed a button and spoke briefly into the microphone on the desk. Her voice echoed back to her over the building intercom. She eyed the other red buttons on the desk. Only one of them, the first on the left, did anything. There was no testing that one. One-time use. The others, like their bright red color, were just for show. She picked up the handgun, it's dark metal cool in her grip. She checked the slide and the safety, then lowered her hand to her side. She did not put down the gun.

Vera turned to Agent Davis, sitting bound to a chair only a few feet away, blindfolded and gagged. With her mind, she untied the gag. The sudden motion, unaccompanied by any proximate human fingers, startled him and he jerked upwards, straining against his fetters.

"How are you hold up?" Vera asked softly, barely audible over the noise of the serves. It was a genuine question, no sarcasm in her voice. "You need any water?" 

"I'll be better when I'm rid of you, freak." Despite the defiant words, Davis' tone was more exhausted than combative. He didn't respond to her question about water. "How much longer?" He tried to sound stoically nonchalant, but the eagerness in his voice was apparent. 

Vera had already told Davis what was to happen today. Or part of it at least. She would be negotiating with the HDU, using his captivity as a bargaining chip. He had clearly thought her plan was crazy and even expressed skepticism that HDU would cede anything of significance in exchange for his release, but he had been prudent enough to hold his tongue. If your captor says that they will let you go unharmed, best not to complain.

"They're here already. Once they muster up the courage to enter, I don't think negotiations will take long." *In fact, there will be a very strict deadline,* though Vera did not divulge this to her hostage. "I want to apologize for kidnapping you. I needed information and this was the way to get it." Her words surprised both of them. She wasn't sure why she was justifying herself to this man who would no doubt kill her if she could, who, in fact, had tried to do so and had been in the process of kidnapping another like her when she intervened.

For a moment, Agent Davis seemed about to reject her pseudo-apology. Then he sighed, shrugged his shoulders (or approximated a shrug, bound as he was), and said, "Eh, occupational hazard."

Vera smiled at that despite herself. She was glad that Davis would be safe during what was to come. Safe as he could be, considering.

"Well, time for the gag to go back on." Davis didn't protest or struggle was the cloth wrapped itself around his face once more, tying into a knot behind his scalp.

***

Outside, HDU troopers in full riot gear poured out of a vehicle towards the data center, only to come to a stuttering halt and retreat. Vera simultaneously watched this unfold on her monitors and tracked their progress with her more direct awareness. She found their sudden retreat amusemening. They must have noticed the signs she had posted on all the doors. On them was written, in large block letters,

"HALT. BUILDING WIRED WITH EXPLOSIVES. AGENT JOSHUA DAVIS INSIDE. SEND SINGLE, UNARMED NEGOTIATOR OR WILL DETONATE EXPLOSIVES."

After a few moments quiet, as HDU and law enforcement officials milled about at a safe distance, a man exited one of the HDU vans and began confidently striding towards the building. He had closed cropped brown hair, was clean-shaven and wearing a dark navy suit. He seemed middle aged, though closer than that, Vera couldn't guess. The very image of a g-man. She thought she could see an ear piece on one side of his face, but couldn't be sure over the security camera feeds.

He reached the main entrance of the data center and unhesitatingly stepped inside. As he did so, she felt the suppressors turn on. Her awareness collapsed in, limited to just the senses of her body. It had been a long time since she had felt this and longer still since she was their target. The sense of confinement grated at her, made her want to scream and run.  She had expected this, however, and had braced against it. In fact, it was somewhat of a relief. Matters were out of her hands now. She couldn't undo or stop her trap even if she wanted to now. All the internal debate and moral quandaries evaporated. The person who had brought this day into existence was a past Vera, not her, not anymore. All she could do was work with the hand her past self had dealt her.

None of this distracted her from lifting her wrist and starting the timer on her digital watch. *Twenty minutes. Ten for the bindings to fail. Ten for the rest.* She had practiced and calculated and testing for this. She was as confident in her timing as was possible. What was less certain was her aim. Only so much precision was possible there.

The man, the negotiator presumably, had stepped into the lobby, and was now looking around, his demeanor evincing minor curiosity rather than impatience or concern. Vera pressed and held the intercom button. 

"If you are carrying any weapons, leave them on the table there. Then proceed through the metal detectors and enter the doors ahead of you." The negotiator didn't hesitate. He walked straight through the metal detectors and advanced through the doors as instructed., not even pausing to see if any alarms would go off.

Vera continued to use the intercom to guide him through the building to her. In just over four minutes, he stood before her at a distance of some ten meters, where she told him to stop. 

She refined her estimate of his age. The negotiator was in his mid-forties, though without her powers, she couldn't be confident of that. A prominent jawline gave him a determined look. His dark eyes looked over to Agent Davis, seemed to evaluated the hostage's condition in a glance, then to the gun held at Vera's side, and then returned to focus on Vera. Remained relaxed but ready to spring into action, waiting for her to move first. She saw several things in that face, in those thin lips. A certain patience had been clear in his every step. Now she saw that this was born not out of acceptance of what was to come but instead out of an arrogant confidence, a surety that this man knew exactly how this day would end. He looked at Vera not as an equal to be negotiated with but as a uppity child who needed to be reminded of her place. An angry resentment flared in Vera, though she did her best to remain calm.

"I am Vera Kelly." This statement was met by a slight nod, a confirmation that he did indeed know who she was. She did not bother introducing Agent Davis. There was no time for pleasantries and honorifics here. "Are you empowered to negotiate on behalf of the Homeland Defense Unit?"

"I am." The voice was low, lower than Vera expected, a resonant baritone. He did not elaborate or introduce himself. Vera was grateful for the time saved.

"My proposal is this. The HDU turn off the suppressors and withdraw. You agree to stop hunting me and allow me to return to my life. In return I will release Agent Davis, will agree never to use my powers again, and will not reveal the HDU's existence. You may even vet the excuse that I will use to account for my disappearance." 

This was a bluff, of course. Vera had no intentions of giving up her powers. She only proffered this because she knew that the HDU would reject it. It was important how they would reject it however: on what points would they fixate, what would they be willing to concede, how far up the chain of authority they would need to go. Despite expecting the denial, she was surprised in the manner in which it came.

"No." As with his every action, the negotiator said this without hesitation, as if he didn't even need to consider her words, as if anything she offered would receive the same response. Vera looked for any elaboration in his expression and found none. Only that arrogant condescension. 

"Would you care to offer a counter-proposal?" Some annoyance crept into her voice.

The negotiator (though Vera was finding it harder and harder to think of that title as applicable to him) shrugged. "Your unconditional surrender." He said it as if was the most obvious thing in the world.

Vera's eyes narrowed slightly. She hadn't expected much, but this intransigence was beyond the pale. Thirteen minutes remained. It was time to make the stakes clear. 

She poured ice into her voice, "If we do not reach a settlement in the next ten minutes, you, Agent Davis, and everyone assembled outside will die today." She said this without raising the gun. The man was aware of it already, she didn't have to engage in petty theatrics. 

"No." Once again, that maddening monosyllabic reply, said in the same dismissive tone. This time, however, there was more. "Agent Davis and I will die, yes, if you have the heart for it, by that gun or by your explosives. And you will die. The data center may be damaged or destroyed, but we do not believe that you have sufficient explosives to threaten our perimeter. Costly, but acceptable."

Was he bluffing? Was he really that ready to die? Would the HDU really be unwilling to concede anything to avoid this? These questions raced through Vera's mind. Eleven minutes. *Well if they won't listen to me...*, she thought as she stepped behind the restrained Agent Davis and untied the knot of his gag with her free hand. She had to struggle with the cloth a bit, finding it hard to untie by hand that which she had tied with telekinesis. The negotiator waited patiently, bemused. 

When the cloth fell free, Vera spoke again, while maintaining eye contact with her adversary. "Agent Davis, I have held you captive for a month. Have I ever failed to keep my promise during that time?" 

Davis chuckled bitterly. "No. You're a vicious bitch, but an honest one."

"So if I say that everyone will die today without a settlement, do you believe me?"

Davis thought about this for a moment. Then he said, in practically a whisper, "Yes."

The negotiator spoke up now, also not taking his eyes from Vera's. "Agent Davis, you will forgive me for not believing you after a month of captivity and torture at the hands of such a person."

A nervous anxiety began to break through Vera's focus. Only ten minutes remained and she didn't want anyone to die today. She didn't want to kill *anyone*, even this infuriatingly, smug asshole. Hurriedly, she turned one of the monitors around to face her interlocutor. 

"A demonstration," she said and pressed the first bright red button. An explosion was visible for a split second through one of the cameras before that feed went dead. A moment later a low rumble echoed from a far corner of the facility. Vera's finger moved above the second of ten buttons. At this, the negotiator paused, he's eyes unfocused as he listened to voices on his earpiece. 

"You're bluffing. We've swept the exterior. Any explosives you have are inside and insufficient to reach the perimeter." His surety was undiminished though some of his patience had departed him. The vacancy was filled by an openly cruel anger. "Let me be clear, we will have you today, dead or alive. You have evaded us long enough. You're a monster, a rabid dog who cannot be allowed free in society. You crushed a van-full of our agents. Who knows what atrocities you have committed while on the run from us. You will not be allowed to crawl back into whatever cave you have been living in to avoid our sensors."

This verbal explosion, and it was an explosion in comparison to his previous curtness, rocked Vera on her heels. Not the viciousness or the commitment, she had come to expect no less from this man. She was somewhat surprised at the casualness with which he had dismissed the destruction if this facility, which was worth more than a billion dollars and would be difficult to keep quiet. But it was the explanation in the last sentence that struck her most deeply. *He thinks I have been hiding underground for ten years. That I found some cave they didn't know about in the mountains of Vermont.* Sudden clarity filled her. *They don't know I can mask myself even while sleeping.* And if they didn't know that, what else did they not know? *Davis said the HDU had been in operation for decades! They must have captured more than a dozen people like me in that time. How can they have learned so little? They have no clue what I am capable of.* 

Of course this man, this representative of the entire HDU, was dismissive of her. They thought her capable of no more than parlor tricks, no better than a cheap stage magician, albeit a particularly violent, dangerous one! And to think, that was enough to inspire the creation of the entire HDU but not enough to inspire one jot of humility or caution! Of course they wouldn't negotiate. She was a fool for thinking that they would. Why would an elephant negotiate with a mouse? 

A powerful dread replaced her clarity just as suddenly.  Now hundreds of people would die because she had made the mistake of overestimating her opponents knowledge. *I have fucked up. I have fucked up.* Her mind raced as all of the suppressed doubts and self-recriminations came surging back up. *You could have staged a demonstration! You could have just let Davis go! Look at what your arrogance has done!*

Some of this inner turmoil must have expressed itself on her face, as the negotiator was now studying her curiously. His gaze pulled Vera out of herself.

"Listen to me, you have to evacuate your people! You don't have to agree to anything, just pull them back a kilometer! You must!" Her steely control was gone. Desperation shone on her face.

Unfortunately, the HDU negotiator seemed to interpret this as the desperation of trapped prey. A smirk appeared on his lips. "Will you surrender now? Or shall I call the troops in?"

Vera stared at him, uncomprehending. What could she say to him? What could she do?

The hostage, meanwhile, believed Vera. Maybe the month's worth of captivity had inculcated a certain trust in him. Maybe he was just exhausted and ready to be free. Or maybe he was disconcerted by the desperate despair in the voice of one whom he had only known as calmly confident. Either way, he began struggling against his fetters, rocking the chair. "Listen to her, man! She isn't fucking joking! We are all going to die if you don't do something!"

Davis' words pierced the arrogant surety of the negotiator. For the first time, something other than arrogance was visible on his face: doubt. He opened his mouth repeatedly, looking for something to say. Then anger won out. He would not be deceived by this freak. "Enough! Cease the theatrics! I am --"

He was interrupted by a repeated, high pitched beep emanating from Vera's wrist. Her watch alarm was going off. Five minutes remained. Hardly enough even if everyone piled back into their vehicles and sped away immediately. The beeping, rather than escalating Vera's frantic urgency however, restored her calm commitment. 

She reached across herself and turned off the alarm. Then, she gripped her pistol with both hands, flicked the safety off, and pointed it directly at the negotiator's face. She knew his center of mass was a better target if she wanted to kill him but she preferred to scare him. She wanted him to directly down the barrel of a gun while he considered his next action.

"Tell your people to withdraw." She said icily, starring daggers at her foe. "At bare minimum, relay my warning to them and let them choose whether to stay or to go. Or I pull this trigger. Your people have less than five minutes left. I can't stop it now."

The negotiator starred back at her, hate flaring in his eyes but otherwise contained. "The team outside hears you," he said equally icily. "They are discussing the matter."

The seconds sped by, all too fast for Vera's liking, as the negotiator listened to voices talking in his ear. She could see them tick by on the inside of her wrist as she kept the gun steady before her. Four minutes left. Then three and a half. She hated how blind she felt without her powers. How desperately she wanted to listen in on the conversation happening outside, to intervene in that discussion. But there was nothing she could do now. Nothing but wait. Right at the three minute mark, the negotiator spoke again.

"They have reached their decision." Vera didn't relax in the least. Some of the anger in the man's voice had dissipated. He seemed resigned now, though his eyes still shone with condescension. "They will not retreat. They are about to send in a team to retrieve all of us. You can shoot me. You can shoot Agent Davis. You can press all the little buttons you like. But you can't stop them. Maybe you should just shoot yourself and save us all the trouble."

These words should have hurt Vera. They should have been the instantiation of her missteps. They *were* that. But Vera's frantic despair had been replaced by a resigned sadness. Less than two minutes now. Those outside not longer had time to flee now even if they wanted to. The assault team even now gearing up to approach wouldn't make it to her in time. It was going to be a massacre. 

She slowly walked around the table, keeping the gun trained on the negotiator. She didn't want him pulling anything foolish here at the end. No heroics. She positioned herself halfway between Agent Davis and the negotiator, ignoring the frantic rocking from the former and the confusion on the face of the latter. They should be safe here, in the center of the building, but her experiments and calculations had left too much uncertainty for complete confidence. It was too great a distance and the atmosphere was too chaotic for any real precision. If something went wrong, she would only have an instant to try and save all three of their lives.

At the thirty second mark, Vera flicked the safety on the gun, pulled out the magazine, and unloaded the round in the chamber, letting it fall to the floor. The negotiator's confusion elevated into bafflement. Vera threw the gun as far as she could in one direction and the magazine in another. Both clattered and bounced off metal server racks out of sight. She kicked the round away, sending it spinning across the floor.

The negotiator stood still, uncertain what to do. Should he charge her or wait for the assault team to arrive? He started quietly describing what was going on to his listeners, evidently thinking this woman had gone crazy. Vera ignored his mutterings and closed her eyes. Ten seconds now. She stretched her fingers, glad to be rid of the cold iron, rolled her shoulders, and readied herself. Her mind was no longer on the countdown. She would be prepared, whether it happened in an instant or an eternity. She waited.

Her arrogant interlocutor chose his moment to strike. He lunged forward at her. One step, then another, closing the short distance between them, accelerating for a full body tackle. Vera heard him coming but did nothing to brace for his impact. His proximity was what she wanted. *Just breathe and be ready.*

Then it happened, simultaneously all at once and stretched across eons. Vera's powers came rushing back to her, extending her senses and filling her with potential. At that instant, she pulled both the airborne negotiator and Davis towards her, the latter's physical fetter's falling away as if no more than gossamer. In their place, both individuals felt their arms and legs pinned by an invisible force, unable to move even their necks and scarcely able to breathe. Both came to a stop floating bound within inches of Vera when the world exploded. 

A loud rumble shook the building, an explosion cracked through the server room, and the air was filled with debris of metal shards and concrete dust and twisted rebar. Everything was noise and motion, the air opaque. A bubble surrounding the trio remained untouched however. Debris glanced off in some other direction, missed altogether, or simply came to a sudden halt and fell harmlessly to the ground. The dust that filled the chamber kept a polite distance from them. It was like standing in the eye of hurricane, a space of calm and safety that could at any moment collapse into chaos and violence.

Vera was tense, sweating. Doing so much so quickly was by no means easy. She had to not only pull in both of her hostages (for the negotiator was certainly a hostage now) and keep them restrained, she had to keep shrapnel and shockwaves that she could not predict from ripping them to shreds. Thankfully it was over in a moment. Dull rumblings continue to periodically echo forth from some distant location, massive hammers striking the very earth like an anvil over and over and over again. But no more proximate threat presented itself. 

*I guess only one went awry,* Vera thought, though she didn't lower her guard. She remained stationary, shielding them from harm, until the last distant thud dissipated. She stretched forth her awareness then, searching the skies for any more heavenly missiles. She found nothing. Then she focused on the torn earth surrounding the data center. What she found made her want to vomit, but she restrained herself. *You can't undo that*, she told herself. *All you can do is make use of it now.*

She opened her eyes and turned towards the levitating negotiator. His eyes met hers, wide with terror, his muscles straining futilely against his invisible binds. 

"You were right," Vera said. "I didn't have enough explosives. Why would I need them? I am capable of so much worse. You doubted me, so now you shall be made to see. Come."

The three of them floated away from the floor, the dust flowing out of their path as if swept by an invisible current. Soon it was clear to the hostages that they were rising out of a massive hole in the ceiling, pipes and conduit and rebar sheared and twisted at the edges of the space. Above was the clear, cloudless sky of the Nevada summer. They rose up into that sky, the desert heat slamming into them with almost palpable force. The hostages blinked in the sudden bright sunlight. Finally, they were able to see. At the same moment, they found that they could move their necks once more. Vera floated between them pointing down and outwards. Their gaze turned to follow. Once they realized what they were seeing, a flood of sensations swept over them. Davis vomited, much of it ending up on his chest, though it was unclear if it was from what they saw or simply the vertigo of being so high up with seemingly nothing to prevent them from falling to their deaths.

***

Three days ago, Vera had relocated herself and her hostage to the top of a small mesa a short distance from the data center. She had set up a barebones campsite, hidden among some rocks and desert shrubs, made sure that Davis was safe and secured, and began her work. The idea had come to her years ago, when, while daydreaming, she happened to think about a science fiction space opera novel that she had read as a child and whose title she could no longer recall. A way of potentially walking into HDU suppressors and then walking out again. She read textbooks on aerodynamics and physics and atmospheric dynamics. She had performed calculations and made estimates of energy and accuracy. She had run experiments in the desert of Arizona and northern Mexico to refine those estimates and to test her own ability to pull something like this off. And now she was putting all that preparation to practice.

She searched across the nearby desert for boulders of a particular size and shape. She took her time, as she had found that small imperfections could have significant impacts on aim. None were perfect and some required breaking and grinding and chipping into the proper shape. These were not small rocks. They were all between three and four meters across, weighing at least a hundred tons each, ideally as close to spherical as possible for consistency. The work of selecting and shaping was done quietly, carefully, to avoid detection by  either the HDU or by more mundane observers, not that there were many in this stretch of desert.

By nightfall, she had selected more than two dozen such rocks and in the secrecy of darkness she began the next phase. She brought the rocks together and bound them with twists and knots of the invisible thread that constituted her power. She wove into them secrecy and durability. Inert, dead objects, they would not retain these weavings for long, but Vera's skill had come a long way from her days in the mountains of New England. She could make her work last hours rather than minutes and that was sufficient.

Then she arranged the rocks in a ring around the data center, placing them directly above the likely areas that the HDU would deploy their perimeter, and adjusting for the prevailing winds of the upper atmosphere in this region. At last she began elevating them, raising them up into the sky. Higher and ever higher. Beyond human sight. Beyond the atmosphere itself, to where gas persisted in only the thinnest degree. She would work for hours, slowly elevating them, careful to not emit a stray signal lest the HDU arrive to early or grow suspicious of this signal in the sky. Then she would renew her bindings upon them, so that they could remain stationary in the sky, long enough for her to care for hostage and rest for a bit herself. Such weight at such distance strained her abilities. She found herself having to take breaks more and more often, her focus and power kept slipping away. But she pushed on and the rocks rose ever higher.

It took her three nights and two days of such shifts to reach her target altitude of one hundred kilometers. From here, once her powers were stolen and her bindings wore out, the rocks would hurtle downwards, not with the power of mystical telekinesis but with simple, mundane gravity. They would hit the ground at a speed of more than a thousand kilometers a second and with the energy of more than two tons of TNT each. It was simple. It was brutal. It was effective. 

***

Now she could see just how brutal and effective it had been. Through the dissipating dust, what had once been asphalt and sand and desert shrubs was no a pockmarked mess of massive craters, each many meters in diameters. Rock fragments and chunks of asphalt and concrete varying in size from pebbles to boulders lay strewn about the landscape. As were overturned vehicles and bodies, some whole, some in parts, none moving. 

What the hostages felt at this sight, Vera did not know. She was too swept up in her own emotions. She wanted to scream, to cry, to lash out, to curl up, to disappear, to explode. She wanted to search for survivors despite her telekinetic senses having already confirmed that each and every person below her was either dead or dying, beyond her ability to save. She saw the vans and trucks crushed and broken. One of them, looked just the same as the van she had crumpled those years ago. Inside it where the remains of two or three people, mangled to such an extent that Vera couldn't be sure. Did it matter at all that they died at the hands of gravity and shockwaves rather than telekinesis? Vera didn't think so.

*This was not what I wanted*, she told herself. She had wanted to threaten the HDU, to convince them to pull back and witness her power from a distance. *I wanted to scare them, not kill them!* Or so she kept insisting to herself. And yet she had chosen this path. Chosen to risk exactly this outcome if the HDU was a little too intransigent, a little too slow.

But she held onto some small hope. There were two witnesses to this. She had been able to save them at least. Perhaps they would return to their lives and their offices and their superiors to tell what they had seen. Perhaps this carnage would put an end to this madness. She didn't deserve freedom, not anymore, but maybe at least they could all have peace.

The negotiator's words broke through her sorrow.

"You will pay for this." There was no hint of fear or regret or humility in those words. Only pure and utter loathing. "We will hunt you down and drag you from your hole and inflict such pain upon you." He practically spat the words, completely unconcerned with his own safety, with the fact that even now, only Vera's active will kept him from falling to his death and joining his dead comrades. Davis meanwhile, starred blankly at the massacre site, horrified into silence.

These words doused Vera's remaining hope. There was no deterrence to be found here, no settlement to be made, only an irrational, indiscriminate hate. Davis' reasonableness had led her to expect the same from others at HDU, but now she saw the truth. If this was the man that the HDU would put in charge of negotiations, there was no negotiations to be had. If she wanted to break the will of the HDU, she would have to deal out far more death and carnage than this. And how could she do that, when it was her will that was broken here today?

She said nothing in response to his words. For a long time, she just stared at him, sadly. At last, she turned away and gently lowered the pair down to the desert floor. Once their feet were firmly on the ground, she released them. Then she flew away, tears streaming from her face.

***

Nightfall found Vera many miles away, huddled in a slot canyon, consumed by the endlessly replaying images of the dead and the dying, of crushing and breaking, of exhaustion and despair. She hardly knew whether these memories were from ten years ago or ten hours ago. The future seemed an impossible thing. She wept until she had no tears, sobbed until her voice was hoarse, rocked herself until, exhausted, she could move no more. 

Hours passed. Maybe even days. Vera was oblivious to her surroundings, even as she grew more thirsty and more hungry. She only stirred when she needed to relieve herself. Even for that, she walked only a few feet off. Soon she doubted she would make even that effort. She no longer felt she deserved life. She deserved to be among her own filth. The van was the unplanned lashing out of an exhausted and scared girl. But this? This was premeditated murder by a woman at the height of her powers, possessed by a proud confidence that she could reshape the world as she pleased. It wasn't even just the HDU there! There were cops who had no idea what they were getting into. She deserved to burn for this. She could have walked away. She could have fled the country or lived out her life underground. Instead she chose murder.

If it were the crushing guilt alone, she may have resorted to suicide. Or maybe she would have turned herself in to the police or even the HDU themselves. But another thought kept squirming in her mind. Amid all of her internal protestations that this was a mistake, that she hadn't wanted this, that she deserved a miserable death for what she had done, was the recollection that the action, the massacre, had indeed been premeditated, had been planned well in advance. Thought she tried to deny it, was this not exactly what she had worked for? To strike a blow against her oppressors? To make them feel the fear that she had felt for so long? Why then tear herself apart of this? Was it not a success? Something to revel in?

These thoughts shamed her and sent her into another spiral of guilt and despair. This contradiction in her soul, this tension between remorse and vindictive pleasure, is what kept her paralyzed in that canyon. Her mind couldn't manage more than the most basic of thoughts and couldn't help but think those same thoughts over and over. All reasoning and logic were beyond her, as was any hope of salvation.

At some point she realized, through that belated recognition of an absence, that she wasn't wearing her quieting charm. She had removed it before, well before... she couldn't finish that thought. And she had been too distraught to intentional mask her signal. Yet the HDU had not approach her in this canyon. Surely the canyon walls were not so high to protect her completely. Perhaps they no longer had sufficient forces nearby to mount another assault. Or perhaps they were scared of walking into another trap. But this line of thought had already stretched for longer than she could bear and her mind collapsed in on itself again. Let them come if they want.

Nothing practical prevented Vera from returning to her itinerant life. All the HDU had learned was that she still lived and was still a threat. They had no further leads on her usual haunts or lifestyle. They still had no means of tracking her if she didn't want to be found. She could have gone on the lam, returned to the same casinos, the same diners, the same libraries. She could have buried herself in the books that were her only companions. She could have listened to the voices and stories of the folks she had come to love in that distant way of hers. She could live out her days doing so.

But that future, like all futures, seemed closed to her. Whether her act had been a crime or a victory, to turn back and act like hadn't happened would be to rob it of its significance. She couldn't do that to all those who died today. She couldn't let herself just move on like that.

And so she remained locked in confused despair, imprisoned in that remote, nameless canyon as the sun rose and set in uncounted days. Eventually dehydration would cut the Gordian Knot and claim her. She almost looked forward to it, to dying the anonymous, ignoble death of an outlaw. 

But then she felt something tugging at her. It had been going on for many minutes, perhaps more than an hour before she consciously noticed it. Not a physical sensation. An erratic vibration in her awareness. The signal of someone using telekinesis. And doing so ineptly, ignorantly. The signal of a new awakening. Vera's mind clung to it like a lifeline cast to the drowning. This was something real, something tangible, some sign that she wasn't alone. It was far off but Vera traced it, followed it back to its source. It was coming from some several hundred miles west of her, likely on the coast of California. 

Vera stirred now in body as well as mind. Salt cracked on her eyelids and joints. Her throat roared with thirst, her tongue sandpaper in her mouth, her stomach an empty pit. Her eyes opened, perceiving for the first time the place she had intended for a grave. The sandstone walls stretched above, their upper reaches shining bright in the morning sun. Where Vera lay coiled, however, was still in the shadow, lit instead with the rosy glow of diffuse light on stone. Slowly she sat up, her mind still focused on the signal, on what it meant. 

Somewhere out there was another person like her. Another person doomed to die an anonymous, ignoble death, likely sooner rather than later. Vera may no longer deserve to live, but this person? This person had done nothing wrong and had no idea of the hell that was about to descend upon them, a hell that they in no way deserved. And Vera could prevent that. Vera could give them another chance at life, a chance to do better than she had done. She had the opportunity to do this before, to prevent a kidnapping. Instead she had chosen to kidnap someone herself, had chosen violence. This time she could choose differently. This time she *would* choose differently.

Vera struggled to her feet, her body screaming at her. But she chose to revel in that sensation, that proof that she was still alive, just as she reveled in the thought that so too was another person like her. If she could get there in time.

## Chapter 9 - A Decision

*Three years before the Proclamation*

"We cannot allow ourselves to become mass murders. And even if we did, we won't cow the HDU into submission by force," Vera said. It was unlike her to participate so directly or so early in a Sodality conclave. She preferred to be sparing in the use of her informal authority over the community, to allow them to make a decision collectively, and only provide advice or direction when it was explicitly sought of her. This was too important, however. She needed to make both a practical and a moral argument. "We have to persuade others who have less stake. Government leadership. The public. They do not have a clear picture of us. They are not precommitted to our destruction."

"I'm not saying we negotiate with the HDU. I'm saying we destroy them, then negotiate with the others from a position of strength." Ezekiel would not be so easily deterred from his course.

"If we impress our will upon them by force, they will resent us for it." Arsène had rejoined the debate. "We'll always be looking over our shoulder. They will try to kill us in our sleep. They will invent new devices to overthrow us. A global suppressor or some other weapon that we cannot protect ourselves against."

"Are not some violent revolutions successful, my friend?" Young Damián spoke up. "I know your home country gained its independence peacefully but most are not so lucky. And the world is not an endless series of revenge killings."

"None of you have lived through a bloody war," Aubrey replied. "I have. I promise you, if we can avoid it, we should."

"We cannot avoid it." Ezekiel insisted. "It is already upon us, whether we like it or not. They want to capture and kill telekinetics. We are telekinetics. It's as simple as that."

"We have to be better!" Arsène's voice was full of passion. "Our powers provide us an opportunity to show everyone that a better future is possible. That we can overcome oppression without perpetuating the cycle of violence!"

This discussion stretched on for some time. Unlike the first question, this one had no simple binary answer. Revolutionary tactics came in a wide variety of forms and degree. Vera wondered to what extent they would be able to reach consensus, even among these few dozen members of a close-knit community.

Eventually Xinyue cut into the debate over the ethics and effectiveness of violence. "A practical question, if I may, Ezekiel?" The room quieted. "If we were to attack HDU facilities and personnel. How would you do it? Considering that they operate suppressor fields."

Ezekiel nodded. "Vera has already shown us that it is possible. Their suppressor fields only reach so far. We only need to attack from beyond their range. Let momentum and gravity do the rest." Vera felt sick in her stomach realizing this is the lesson Ezekiel had learned from her life.

"And how do you plan on accomplishing this without killing the telekinetic captives in those facilities?" Xinyue asked. "The ones whose imprisonment justify this violence?"

Ezekiel flushed. "Well obviously we would need to be careful. I'm sure we can come up with some clever uses of our power to target specific parts of the buildings."

"And how would you know where in the building the captives are being held?"

"Well...um..."

"I do not mean to call you out specifically Ezekiel. I think we all have been making a general mistake in this discussion." Xinyue folded her hands together on the table before her and was speaking quite deliberately. "We have been thinking of this situation from the perspective of telekinetics versus those who hunt telekinetics."

"Is that not the case?" While Ezekiel was the one who voiced the question, even Arsène looked confused by Xinyue's line of thought.

"Yes, but we are not *only* telekinetics. We are first and foremost people." A burst of joy and pride filled Vera as she realized where Xinyue was going. *That's my girl.*

"If we think of ourselves as only telekinetics, we practice the same reductionism that the HDU does," Xinyue continued. "Their entire organization is designed around their secret war against telekinetics. We should not fight them on the battleground that they have chosen. We should chose another battleground. Multiple preferably."

"Like what?" Ezekiel was intrigued now.

"Well for one, mundane infiltration." A wave of gasps swept the room.

"Surely you don't mean one of us just walks in?" Flora gave voice to the concerns of the group.

"Why not? They certainly won't be expecting it." Xinyue shrugged. "And if we think that too risky, what about a cyber-intrusion? What do you think, Antonio?"

Antonio starred up at the ceiling, considering the question. "I don't think I could do it alone. But I know some people who might be willing to help, if I was able to convince them that the target would be sufficiently entertaining. It will take time though. This isn't like the movies, where a hacker can just slap a keyboard around for a few seconds."

Xinyue nodded. "If successful, we could learn where specifically the captives are being held, which would inform where and how we attack." Now Ezekiel was nodding too. "It may also provide us with information that we could take public. We will need more than words to win hearts and minds. We will need clear evidence to paint a vivid picture of who's the good guy and who's the bad guy."

"We could prepare public demonstrations of positive uses of our abilities," added Roseanne, the closest thing Emancipación had to a doctor. 

"Yes! And I'm sure there's other approaches that we could think of too!" A clear excitement had crept into Xinyue's affect. "HDU doesn't know where we are. They don't even know for sure that we exist. They certainly don't know when or how we'll strike. When we do strike, we should hit them hard and from many different angles. They will fight the only way they know how, which will allow us to take ground in the public debate. That's what our strategy would be."

The dam was broken now and numerous potential ideas for concrete action began being proposed. Some were impractical or downright ridiculous, but many had some merit. Eventually the need for dinner brought the meeting to a close for the day. Subsequent discussions established a timeline for preparations, a general strategy, and several working groups to fill in the details.

***

Vera sat in a rocking chair on the porch of the meal hall, watching the afternoon activity of Emancipación, and drinking a glass of water. While soon many members would depart to their respective safehouses or on novel missions to prepare for the imminent struggle, for now the commune was a bustling hive of activity, busier than it had ever had been, both in terms of sheer number of people but also with their collective level of excitement. She could see the rapid exchange of ideas in the psychic webs around her. And to think, a few decades ago, she was along and without hope. *How far we have come since then.*

She was beyond pleased with the outcome of the conclave. Vera had a high level of trust in the decision-making and reconciliation capacities of the Sodality, but still she had feared that this would have torn a rift in the community. Or, worse yet, that the Sodality would have embarked on a bloodthirsty warpath. Unlike Arsène, she was not categorically against the use of violence, but her past experience had made her skeptical of its utility. She had had more than enough of senseless death of one lifetime. 

Still though, she was worried that this discussion had not resolved the underlying disagreements but had only papered them over. A struggle against oppression, violent or peaceful, rarely went according to plan. She had learned that all too painfully. How would Ezekiel, Arsène, or other members of the Sodality react in the heat of combat? How would they respond when one of their own was killed? And she was confident that exactly that would happen. No war is without its casualties.

This thought cast a somber tone over the excited, happy labor going on all around her. *Who among us won't be here five years from now? In ten years?* She wondered, not for the first time, if she should have argued for Julian's pseudo-proposal, for maintaining the status quo. Despite Ezekiel's minor act of defiance, the community respected her and heeded her opinion far beyond what she thought was warranted. If she had put her foot down, they would have listened. *But they would have resented me for it and the Sodality may have been harmed even more surely for it. This is a community, not a dictatorship. We reached a decision together. Now we have to see it through, for better or worse.*

So lost in thought was she that she hadn't noticed Lucas coming around the corner until he was taking the rocking chair next to hers. *The boy has a talent for stealth,* she realized. Perhaps it was the result of his long imprisonment, a deeply ingrained instinct to make himself small, unnoticed. Yet another special skill among many among the Sodality.

"Will it work?" Lucas wasn't looking at her. Instead, like Vera, he was watching the activity of the ranch with more than just his eyes.

Vera took a sip from her glass and she considered her response. "It has to."

## Chapter 10 - A Beginning

*Twenty nine years before the Proclamation*

"Emancipación is not a place. It is an ongoing project, an evolving experiment." Vera often said this about the place the Sodality called home. While the bustle of activity just after the Hayward Conclave, as it became to be known, was unprecedented, the ranch had always been a site of labor, a place where the future was being built, often quite literally. The founding of Emancipación, the seed from which the Sodality grew, was not in the mountains of Bajío however. Nor was it in some frenzied dream of salvation of an exhausted, half-mad Vera Kelly as she sped from the desert of Nevada to the bay of San Francisco, heedless of the dangers of daytime flight. Instead, as Vera always insisted, it lay in a moment of surprising trust between too scared women in a library study room at the University of California, Berkeley.

That is where Vera had found Li Xinyue, undergraduate and newly awakened novitiate, testing her newfound abilities. Covered in salt and sunburn, Vera had entered the locked room and sat down at the one other chair, across the small table. Xinyue was dressed casually, in a t-shirt and jeans, her long, black hair tied up into a bun. She did not startle at this wild woman's appearance.

Vera expected her hurried, unprepared explanation to be met with skepticism or alarm. The best she could hope for was astonishment and a flurry of questions. Vera would not have the answer to many of these questions, but maybe, just maybe, she would have the answers to enough to sway this raven haired student, to save her from the horrible fate that was likely barreling down on them, to find some measure of redemption.[^17]

[^17]:In retrospect, Vera need not have felt so rushed. The time between Xinyue's awakening and the conclusion of Vera's explanation far exceeded the HDU's normal response time to this part of the country. The truth was that Vera's regretted demonstration of power had destroyed much of the HDU's forces in the western part of the US and those that remained, in HDU Director Harris' later, embittered words, "had the fear of God put into them." The awakening of a novitiate on that day was thus not the urgent priority it would normally be.

It was thus to Vera's great surprise that Xinyue responded calmly and without hesitation: "We best get a move on then." 

She started to packing her things into her backpack before pausing and shaking her head. Instead, she pulled out two items: a collection of poetry by bell hooks and a notebook. She turned to Vera, "Ready."

Vera wanted to say something, ask something, do something. *Why aren't you asking any questions? How can you walk away from your life so coolly?* But then Vera recalled that she herself had acted just as swiftly and deliberately when she had been in this girl's situation, and Vera had access to substantially less information at the time. So instead of grabbing Xinyue by the shoulders and shaking her, Vera silently acknowledged how lucky she was that her words had been met with acceptance. And with that acknowledgement, Vera nodded and exited the study room, trusting her first recruit to follow her.

Much later Vera would ask Xinyue about this day, about what prompted this bright young college girl to so unhesitatingly run off with this sun burnt, middle-aged stranger. Xinyue considered this question for a long time, clearly viewing the query as having some import. At length, she answered, "Partly it was because your appearance and your explanation was more a confirmation than anything. I had been wondering if there were others like me and why they weren't common knowledge. So I was primed to believe your story. But that was only part of it. The other part, the bigger part, was you. I had never seen anyone move like you or speak like you. You have a mix of determined gracefulness in every movement. You are special. And so you couldn't be lying. And if I came with you, maybe I could learn to be like you."

To this, Vera had nothing to say, but, overcome by emotion, she pulled Xinyue into a tight embrace.[^16]

[^16]: Xinyue was far from the only person, in the Sodality or out of it, to note this trait about Vera Kelly. Post-Proclamation, it was in fact commonly discussed by political commentators and seemed to lend some credibility to the Sodality's demands. Later instances of it being brought up did not leave Vera Kelly speechless like this instance however. She would typically deflect the compliment, attributing the grace and surety of motion to her telekinesis, which, with years of practice, steadied and supplemented her every movement. This explanation leaves much to be desired, however. Most telekinetics, even the well practiced, do not exhibit this grace. And she was frequently noted as being a talented orator, a skill that seems to be little helped by telekinesis. It is thus more likely that Vera Kelly was simply charismatic, either due to some natural predisposition or the honing of years of self-reliant solitude and practice.

***

For three years, Vera and Xinyue repaired and renovated the ranch. They replanted a garden that had been fallow since before they had been born. They installed glass panes in window frames that had always been empty. They returned light and heat to a kitchen that had become accustomed to dust and shadows.

For three years, Vera and Xinyue explored their powers together. Vera taught her the younger woman much certainly, and Xinyue eagerly ingested the knowledge and tricks that to her teacher were hard-won, previous things. But Vera also learned a great deal from her pupil. For all of Vera's creativity and skill, she still only had her one set of eye's to lookout of the world through. So she was repeatedly astounded by the innovations wrought by Xinyue's naïve questions and experiments. It was Xinyue who developed the surveillance wards that the Sodality still relies upon to protect their havens and safe houses even during moments of slumber or inattention. And it was Xinyue who developed the rudiments of telepathic communication that later novitiates would refine and expand into a full-fledged language. Vera also learned a great deal from Xinyue due to the simple fact that there is much that two can do that one cannot. Theories and designs that had dwelt only in Vera's mind could now be tested. So it was that the pair learned to shape the winds and clouds, something that far exceeded any quieting charm, but could be performed discreetly enough with the help of another.

For three years, Vera and Xinyue came to know each other and grow close. They commiserated over lives left behind and discussed lives still to come. Their trust and friendship became such that no later telekinetic, no person including Xinyue's future spouse, ever could feel as close to either as they were to each other. Their philosophies developed through innumerable conversations and debates, growing so intertwined as to be indistinguishable. While many would later attribute the form and ethos of the Sodality to Vera Kelly, including its own members, Li Xinyue is equally responsible for all that it became.

For three years, Vera and Xinyue had only each other. Then they found Ezekiel, whose awakening occurred during a family vacation not from from Emancipación. His gifts came easily to him, more easily than any other member of the Sodality, and he never hesitated to use those gifts to help build up his community or to defend it from threats. He needed little persuasion to abandon his family and follow Vera and Xinyue. Not because he feared capture or had resigned himself to exile, but because he has simply delighted that the hand of fate had reached down to pluck him out of the masses. So eager was he, that Vera had to actively insist that they remain long enough to, from a discreet location, watch the HDU arrive and search in vain for Ezekiel. She did not want him later questioning the reality of his precarity. And he never did.[^22] 

[^22]: Once, when the two were alone, Xinyue asked Vera if she had any thoughts regarding the source of Ezekiel's confidence and enthusiasm that day. Vera responded, "An ego like that has no trouble accepting a cosmic purpose." This was said as though Vera was quoting from some text, but she evidently immediately regretted letting slip such a sentiment and refused to elaborate further. Vera was quite well read, having little else to do for mental stimulation during her years of seclusion. That said, she maintained no personal library and no record of what she read, so it is unclear where precisely this line came from.

It was Ezekiel who was responsible for the naming of the Sodality, thought not the name itself. Only minutes after departing his prior life,[^27] crammed into the middle seat of an old pickup bouncing along through a dirt road through the mountains, he asked the two women seated on either side of him, "So what's this secret society of superheros called anyways?"

[^27]: Not all members of the Sodality had to leave their prior life behind completely. It largely depended on whether they could be rescued quickly and discreetly enough to avoid positive identification by the HDU or local equivalent. This was not the case for Vera, obviously. Nor was it the case for Xinyue (socially active student at a prestigious university suddenly disappearing at the same time as a detected awakening) or for Ezekiel (the scion of a prominent family in the Church of Latter Day Saints disappearing while on vacation in Mexico concurrent with a detected awakening). But for others, such as Tillie and Akin, fairly normal familial and social ties could be maintained.

"It doesn't have a name." Vera said.

"We aren't superheroes," said Xinyue simultaneously.

Ezekiel was started by both responses, but when he tried to articulate his surprise as some combination of query and indignation, Vera just shrugged and Xinyue leaned her head against the passenger window.

"We're just trying to get by," Vera said. "We're not out saving the day from comic book villains. Near as we can tell, they don't exist. Besides, it seems like a nasty, bloody business."

Xinyue followed up, answering the other question. "A group of two isn't exactly a secret society. It's just two people. You and me. Us."

"But now there's three of us! And there will be more. We need a name." Ezekiel seemed willing to drop the semantics of superheroes in pursuit of a name, for now at least. "It could be... Well, it should be something vague, so anyone else who hears it doesn't know what it is. How about... The Brotherhood?"

Vera said nothing, merely stared ahead at the road, her left arm resting on open window sill, her fingers idly twirling in the wind as her right hard remained on the steering wheel. She had a studiously blank expression on her face that only Xinyue knew was her way of politely avoiding laughing at someone who has just embarrassed themselves, a practiced expression necessary for one whose constitution prohibited the telling of even the mildest of white lies. Or as Vera sometimes put it, "You don't need to point out when someone has sat in pig shit. They either already know or they're a pig and don't care." 

Xinyue had only a portion of Vera's restraint, however. Without lifting her head from the window or cracking a smile, she asked in a light, innocent tone, "What about The Sorority?"

"Why would we--" Ezekiel began, before realizing his mistake. He clamped his mouth shut as a pink blush swept over his clean-shaven face. "I didn't-- I mean--"

Xinyue opened her mouth again, but Vera chose this moment to step in, lest her first student's next words prove the end of her second student's remaining dignity. For all her apparent nonchalance, Vera had been seriously considering Ezekiel's question (one of them anyways) since he first asked it. She had been mentally reaching back to her youthful study of small communities, past and present, looking for inspiration. Cooperatives, religious communities, communes, revolutionary cells, hobbyist associations, and political clubs ran through her mind.

"The Sodality." Vera said quietly, her voice almost lost amid the rumble of the bouncing vehicle. She said it as if the answer was obvious. Both of her passengers looked at her as if it was anything but.

After a moment, Ezekiel's bafflement transitioned into curiosity. He uttered an intrigued, "What?"

"It refers to a community bound together by a spiritual task. From the Latin for 'companion'."[^21]

Ezekiel pondered this for a moment. "Well it's certainly cryptic enough. And Latin's a good language for a secret society. *The Sodality.*" He said it slowly, rolling it around in his mouth, testing its shape. Seemingly satisfied, he smiled. "I like. The Secret Sodality."

"Just 'The Sodality', please," Xinyue pleaded.

[^21]:This selection was an odd one and not just due to its obscurity. Vera Kelly consistently and deliberately spoke of the Sodality's actions and goals (as well as her own) in purely secular and pragmatic terms. She sought to defend a specific community from concrete harms. She shared no visions of a grand utopia or reshaping the world. This was made all too clear during The Proclamation. Yet she chose a name most commonly associated with religious organizations and herself defined it in such terms. 

***

The following years saw Emancipación slowly transform from ghost town to thriving commune. Each year saw at least one new recruit and, once regional safehouses were established, sometimes oftentimes more.

Following Xinyue and Ezekiel, there was Flora Becerra, the first "local" recruit and mixed martial arts enthusiast, hailing from Santiago de Querétaro. She quickly proved invaluable as the public face of Emancipación, conducting business and maintaining friendly, though sufficiently distant, relationships with the neighbors. She also swiftly took charge of the kitchen, though she would later hand off most that responsibility to Aubrey so that she could focus more on teaching combat skills, both telekinetic and mundane, to novitiates.

Arsène Laurent was the fourth recruit, a Quebecois bicycle mechanic and anti-war socialist activist. He was found by Xinyue during a brief vacation to Montréal that happened to coincide with his awakening. She had chosen the destination to practice her elementary French,[^28] which led to the humorous misunderstanding where Arsène presumed this pretty American was trying to hit on him. On any other day, he would have been flattered, but couldn't help be distracted by his recent discovery that he could move objects with his mind.

[^28]:The Sodality realized early on that they needed to cultivate fluency in multiple languages, as they never knew who they next novitiate might be and explanations had to take place quickly. Vera was already fluent in Spanish, but other languages had to be more intentionally obtained.

Antonio Aguilar soon followed, a Sinaloan computer auto-didact who even at the age of twenty was managing IT for a sizable office complex. His early contributions to the community included dramatically upgrading the Emancipación security systems and setting up ways for secure digital communications as the Sodality began establishing safehouses.[^29]

[^29]:Such communications methods were rarely used Pre-Proclamation as they were only intended to genuine emergencies, such as the destruction of a safehouse or capture of a Sodality member. Later on, when rapid communications across the globe were necessary, however, Antonio would be proved to be quite farsighted indeed.

Roseanne Allen was next, a Detroit-born pre-med student spending a summer as a public health volunteer in central Mexico. To the Sodality's immense benefit, she continued pursuing her medical vocation alongside her telekinetic training and soon found herself as a general practitioner for not only the human residents of Emancipación but also it's rapidly increasing animal population. This reputation soon spread to the neighbors and Roseanne frequently found herself paying house calls for sick children, horses, and more. While Flora was key in establishing relations with the surrounding community, Roseanne is probably the primary reason why Emancipación has never been found.

And of course many more. Matilda "Tillie" Henderson from Ohio, Aubrey Torres from Venezuala, Julian Oretga from rural Tamaulipas, Akin Oyeleye from Abuja, Ameera Dridi, known by the Francophones members of the Sodality as "Chanceuse",[^25] and many more. It was this wild rabble of disparate views and skills that made up the Sodality and, more so than any act of Vera's, shaped Emancipación into what it was. These were the people who were willing to die for each other and to sacrifice themselves to change the world. Unfortunately, changing the world requires more than a willingness to die.

[^25]:While all successfully rescued novitiates were in a sense lucky, this nickname originated from the circumstances of her rescue. Ameera was living in Amsterdam at the time of her awakening, unfortunately quite close to the headquarters of ODA, the western European equivalent of the HDU. The nearest Sodality safehouse at the time was in Paris, run by myself, meaning it was virtually impossible for me to get to her in time. Ameera's reaction to the awakening saved her. Like some novitiates, she initially assumed that she was going insane, perhaps suffering from a stroke, and likely to die shortly. Instead of hiding or seeking medical attention as is common, Ameera rather resolutely decided that if she were to die young, she would prefer to die in her native Tunisia. So she promptly hailed a cab, went straight to the Amsterdam airport, and was on the next flight to Tunis before the ODA could hunt her down. Conveniently enough, this was an Air France flight that had a layover in Paris. While the ODA were able to identify her en route, the ensuing bureaucratic jurisdictional battle between the ODA and the NSC (the west African HDU equivalent), along with the dozen more mundane law enforcement and civil aviation agencies that soon became involved, meant there was precisely no one waiting to seize her at Charles de Gaulle Airport. Instead there was only myself. I did not even need to sneak in past airport security because I had a ticket for a flight to Lagos not two hours later, to scout out potential safehouse locations for Akin, who was finishing up his training at Emancipación around that time. As such, I was able to calmly meet here at the gate and, after a brief conversation and the gift of a quieting charm, we simply strode out of the airport. It was perhaps the easiest rescue in entirety of the pre-Proclamation period.


## Intermission - A Debacle

*One year before the Proclamation*

Director Harris sat at the large oak desk in his office, reading yet another report on a failed eruption intervention. His thick, graying eyebrows were bunched in concern. He ran one large calloused hand across his salt-and-pepper crew-cut hair and sighed. While this one was in Nigeria and thus, strictly speaking, not his responsibility, an acquisition failure by any of HDU's sister agencies was a serious matter. And it's not like the HDU was blameless either. Eight missed acquisitions in the past five years where the HDU had the authority (and responsibility) for eruption intervention.One in Canada, three the US, two in Central America, and a final one further south in Central America. The global number had been on the rise too. South America, Europe, and the northern half of Africa had all had more failures than successes in the past few years. Just six months ago, East Asia had their first failure. A since the trend had started in North America, many of the intervention agencies were pointing their at the HDU. The scientists had reviewed the data. The engineers had taken apart the equipment and put it back together. These weren't false positives. The Anomalies were getting away. The carefully crafted international system was falling apart.

And the contents of this report were even worse. The previous failures were mysterious and quiet, the eruptions disappearing just before the HDU or one of its sister agencies could arrive. Sometimes aerial surveillance had even been able to identify a specific house, only for the agents to arrive and find a confused family, minus the one person that the agents were there for. This report, however, detailed the NSC agents successfully apprehending and neutralizing the eruption, only for the entire convoy to be assaulted by at least three Anomalies while en route back to base. By some miracle, none of the agents had been killed. After tossing the vehicles around a bit like toys, the Anomalies seized the source of the eruption and departed.

*What am I saying?* Harris thought. *This was no miracle. This was intentional. A demonstration. A threat.* He slammed his fist against his desk, grateful that no subordinates were present to see the outburst. Already the orders had gone out globally that intervention convoys were to have their suppressors running in transit, not just upon arrival. The additional power requirements would complicate logistics and the agents would hate how hot the vehicles would get with the suppressors on, but that was acceptable. 

The Anomalies surely knew this however and didn't care. By Harris' count there were now forty-eight such missing Anomalies from the past few decades. A whole platoon. He shuddered to think of the destructive capability of that many Anomalies working on concert. And he hated sitting here waiting for the hammer to fall.

*Why now?* Harris wondered. *Why under my watch?* Harris was sixty-eight now, had been director at HDU for eleven years, had spent most of his life working his way up the hierarchy, though he had started his career at Langley. He feared the coming years. Wondered if the dam would hold long enough for him to live out his life. He would do the utmost to make sure that it would. 

The HDU and the global system that it was a part of were necessary. It was the universal recognition of that necessity which had resulted in the global eruption intervention system being one of the shining examples of the potential for international cooperation, even though only a precious few had even heard of it. 

Ever since the early 1950s, when the eruptions first began, he and his predecessors had kept the world safe. The first two decades had been a mad scramble. They hadn't had detectors or suppressors back then, had to use more conventional, cruder means of intervention when an eruption occurred. Often they wouldn't even know about the eruption until the person responsible had taken over a town or a tribe or had gone on some kind of rampage. It had taken a great deal of effort to cover up those events as terrorist attacks, crazed killers, and war crimes. Harris shuddered to think about trying to pull that off in this day and age.

But finally, in the late 60s, the scientists had figured out detectors. Just in time for the Space Age. As the nuclear nonproliferation system was being established and spy satellites were being launched, eruption detection systems were being deployed alongside them. When suppressors came online the early 70s, the system was made virtually foolproof. The HDU and its sister agencies were even able to hunt down and round up the handful of eruptions that had managed to be discreet and live mostly normal lives.

The global eruption intervention system was actually significantly more successful than nuclear nonproliferation. Practically every national leader wanted nukes, whether they admitted or not. There had been some initial concern about an arms race that tried to harness Anomalies and turn them into super soldiers. *More like weapons of mass destruction* Harris had always thought. But it turned out that no one wanted Anomalies, not after giving it any serious thought. 

Eruptions happened randomly, all over the world, maybe two to five a year if that, and varied significantly in strength. You couldn't control how many you would have (beyond just having a larger population), thus you couldn't take any action to try and have some superiority over your neighbors or rivals. You also couldn't control who the Anomaly was. A dissident? A would-be revolutionary with fantastic powers? A common criminal? Even if it was some nominally loyal, law-abiding person person, that sort of power tended to give a man ambitions. And ambitions were a dangerous thing when you could kill just about anyone, from a distance, without a trace, without it even looking like a murder. No, no national leader with an ounce of self-preservation (and it was hard to reach such a position without a healthy dose of that instinct) wanted Anomalies running around, no matter how closely monitored. 

And so the global intervention system developed with surprisingly few hurdles. Detection and suppression technology was shared freely. States without the ability to stand up their own intervention agency gladly accepted help from at least one of the many nations that could. The system worked efficiently and comprehensively. The model of a well-run government program.

Harris was not naïve, of course. He was keenly aware of the ethical... compromises that were necessary to make the system run. Most eruption interventions resulted in some amount of collateral damage. And then there were the experiments on the Anomalies themselves. Those left a sour taste in Harris' mouth. If he had his way, the HDU would stop such activities immediately. A quick death for the Anomalies, that was the proper way. But he was a practical man and it was those human experiments that had allowed for the detectors and suppressors  to be developed and improved over the past century. And the HDU had it on solid intelligence that the Russians and Chinese were engaged in such experiments themselves, looking for a way to replicate the Anomalies' powers through technological means. The U.S. couldn't fall behind in such a pursuit. The consequences would be catastrophic. In a world of saints, the HDU wouldn't be necessary. *But we don't live in a world of saints, so men like me have to make the hard choices, do the dirty work to keep everyone else safe.* This was no justifying litany. Harris was confident in his choices. In the HDU's choices.

Collateral and human experiments aside, for nearly sixty years, there was little to complain about at the HDU and abroad. But now that was all falling apart.

Harris knew why. It's why it hit so hard when his colleagues at the sister agencies pointed their fingers at the HDU. At him. This all started with the botched acquisition of one Vera Kelly. He had her file on his desk. It had been there since he took the job. It had been there, growing progressively thicker the entire time he had been director. It had been the same for the previous director. And the director before that. Ever since he had become the director, the top priority of the HDU had been to find and stop Ms. Kelly. He had seen that incident with his own eyes. Only dumb luck - a flat tire - had prevented him, just six months into his new job at the HDU, from dying there himself. He arrived not thirty minutes after the massacre. He was the one to find Agents Joshua Davis and José Martin, the only survivors. Joshua had never recovered and soon retired from the agency, God bless his soul. José was blamed for the incident and never trusted with any real responsibility again. Maybe it was that dishonor that led to his alcoholism and an early grave. Harris himself had spent the bulk of his career, in one capacity or another, trying to track her down. And largely without results. All the while, the number of failed interventions gradually increased and spread across the globe. Ms. Kelly was recruiting, he was sure of it.

*If only the agency had acted earlier!* Harris was embittered by how the agency had behaved following both Ms. Kelly's initial escape and her later act of terrorism. In both cases, the agency had chosen to prioritize secrecy over efficacy. *If only they had enlisted the National Guard to blockade the roads of Vermont and New Hampshire. Check every car for reports of theft. They might have nipped this in the bud.* Those 156 agents who died in Nevada could still be alive. But instead, practically no one in the agency had even aware that there had been an escape. Harris certainly hadn't known, hadn't been informed why such a massive response was required to the alert coming out of Nevada. Eruption interventions usually required one or two dozen men, not several dozen vehicles and local law enforcement! *They hadn't even known what they were walking into!*

Harris shook his head in disgust. And even after Nevada, with José and him demanding a swift response and Davis practically suicidal, what had the agency done? *Fuck all, that's what.* A team of eight agents and a tiny budget to try and hunt down the biggest threat the agency had ever faced. That and orders not to tell anyone about it. They put more effort into the cover-up of what happened that day than they ever did into hunting down Ms. Kelly. Harris's ambition and swift rise through the ranks was driven largely by his desire to get into a position to try and rectify this mistake. *If only I had been in charge sooner, this all could have been prevented.*

He drummed his fingers on the heavy wooden desk, using this precious time between briefings and administrative meetings to consider his options. There was still a chance that the Albuquerque gambit would pay off. That boy had been drilled into compliance for ten years. Perhaps he would call and reveal the location of Ms. Kelly's hideaway, wherever she had absconded with her ilk. He seriously doubted it, doubted it ever since the agent in charge of the pursuit had pitched it to him. *I certainly wouldn't betray the person who had rescued me from years of torment.* No matter how broken the boy had been, he probably wouldn't either. Harris sighed again. His own people had told him as much and the sister agencies would certainly raise holy hell if they knew what he had done. Let an Anomaly go? It had never been done before. It was contrary to the entire purpose of the eruption intervention system. *But, damn it! What else are we going to do? Sit on our asses and wait for Ms. Kelly and her army of superpowered freaks to come knocking?* No, Harris didn't regret the gambit. It's failure would just mean that they would have to try something else.

He glanced over at the thick paper file on the corner of his desk. The director had reviewed the file frequently enough to practically know its entire contents by heart. He idly flipped it open to the first page. There was a photo of Ms. Kelly as she was just before the eruption. A bright, young, perfectly normal college sophomore. More recent, much poorer quality photos, were scattered through the file, gleaned from security cameras and the background of incidental photos taken near various eruption sites.

Born December 5th, 1991 in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Harris recognized the irony there. He had not infrequently wondered if Kelly's existence was some punishment from God, a plague upon him for living a life of secrecy, for his many sins in defense of his country. *Don't be so pretentious. God isn't concerned with my petty sins.* The file also included her psych profile, if you trusted such things. There was something in there that Harris did agree with though. Ms. Kelly was the hero of her own story. A freedom fighter struggling against tyranny, in her own mind at least. But how many struggles for liberation had ended in bloody terror, purges, and autocracy? No matter Ms. Kelly's intentions (and she was no saint, Nevada was proof of that), a world with superpowers run amok would be no utopia. After all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. And if the HDU fell, if the global intervention system fell, the road to hell would be short indeed.

## Chapter 11 - A Prelude

*One month before the Proclamation*

Vera was in the kitchen of the mess hall, preparing dinner for the Sodality. Afternoon light streamed in through the open windows. She was alone, having dismissed the Flora and Damián, the other two cooks on duty today, nominally because they had other urgent duties to attend to, but in actuality because she simply wanted some time alone. The past three years had been a whirlwind of covert missions, scouting expeditions, planning, drills, supply acquisition, and much more. While the Sodality was nominally without leadership, in practice everyone wanted her (and often Xinyue's) approval. This meant much of her time was spent reviewing proposals and attending debriefs. Not that she disliked this state of affairs. She did prefer to be in the loop, to have some measure of control over the situation. But did mean that she, who had long had an overabundance of solitude, now had little time to herself. 

So here she was, chopping peppers and onions by herself. Many tasks (stirring a pot of chile, fetching spices from the shelf, crushing garlic) she used her powers to facilitate, but chopping vegetables was something she preferred to do by hand. She enjoyed the rhythm of it, the degree of regularity that still required some level of attention to avoid cutting oneself, if nothing else. It gave her a sense of normalcy. Food was food and telekinetics, at the end of the day, were human. Though she wasn't above generating a subtle screen of air over her eyes to protect from the onions.

The task was so relaxing in fact, that the sound of heavy boots in the mess hall were her first sign that someone was approaching. She didn't need any extrasensory awareness to identify the wearer of those boots. So much for a couple of hours of solitude.

"How have you found Warsaw?" Vera called over her shoulder. She didn't look up from chopping vegetables but her attention now was firmly on Ezekiel, who stepped into the door. He seemed relaxed, more relaxed than she had almost ever seen him, despite the long trip to get here. She found this odd, considering what they were gathering to do here and his usual impatience. Or maybe he was relaxed precisely because the wait was almost over.

"It has been truly wonderful," Ezekiel sighed contentedly as he started busying himself by levitating the vegetable scraps on the counter over to the compost bin. "The PDP over in Eastern European isn't anywhere near as careful as the HDU. I have found five of their sites already. And rescuing that boy I sent you four months ago was a piece of cake. Maybe you should have founded Emancipación over there." He smiled proudly.

He didn't mention the more recent rescue that he had been involved in, had perhaps been the instigator of, the one in Nigeria that included attacking a convoy rather than reaching the novitiate first. He must have known that Vera did not approve of such overt actions in advance of their attack. It wouldn't do to put their adversaries on alert. But she didn't want to alienate Ezekiel. Not right now. So she chose to ignore that elephant in the room.

"And what about outside of the hunt?" Vera knew well that Ezekiel had been perhaps the worst of her pupils at forging an identity outside of his powers and the struggle that came along with them. *Except for me, perhaps,* she thought to herself. *What is all my community building after all, but my way of advancing that struggle.* Still she held out hope that Ezekiel may have finally found something to give his life some meaning, if only because she still held out hope for herself.

To Vera's great surprise, Ezekiel did indeed have a genuine answer. "Oh, it's been a blast. Carla, this older widow that I am lodging with, has taken it upon herself to introduce me to Poland. She's been showing me the sights, teaching me Polish - I'm practically fluent now - and she even has me working in her antique shop! I never expected to enjoy learning about old furniture and  oil paintings. She has centuries' old pieces for sale! It's like some kind museum! We don't have anything like it on this side of the ocean! It helps that I can cheat a bit when it comes to moving heavy pieces delicately. And I have a real knack for picking out forgeries and damage. Never thought this kind of detailed examinations was what I would use my powers for. Carla calls me her little miracle-worker, even though she's a third of my size. Honestly she was struggling to manage the place on her own ever since her husband died. I'm glad that I came along when I did. It feels good to help out in this way, you know? She treats me like I was her son. I've even taken to calling her *anyukám*."

Vera was astonished at the verbose answer. Where was the young man who wanted nothing except to practice his powers and prepare for war? Who found every hobby she tried to foist upon him boring? Who found most members of the Sodality tedious unless they were talking about (or better yet, doing) telekinesis? Who only begrudgingly learned even a modicum of Spanish?

Her astonishment was not so great as to cause her to overlook the slight contained in his final words. Ezekiel had never used any terms of endearment for her except sarcastically. Unlike many other members of the Sodality, he did not view her as a motherly figure, she knew. And here he was, in a few short years and at the age of 45, practically getting adopted!

Ezekiel had not meant this as a slight, Vera recognized. He probably didn't even realize why he felt this way about Carla and not about her. Self-reflection was never one of Ezekiel's strong suits. But Vera had an inkling. To Ezekiel, a mother, particularly an aging mother, was a caring domestic, one more in need of help than able to provide it, at least in all the ways that mattered to him. Any deference to Carla was built on an indulgent affection that did not threaten his independence. Meanwhile, he respected Vera with the kind of respect due to a skilled teacher or a military commander. Vera had saved his life and, for all his strength and self-confidence, Ezekiel wasn't sure he could best her in a fight or rescue her from a situation that she couldn't rescue herself from. And so Vera *couldn't* be a mother in his eyes. Not like this Carla could.

Vera kept these suspicions to herself as she continued to prepare dinner with Ezekiel's assistance. Instead, she continued to ask questions about his life in Poland, questions that he was eager to answer. Her identity did not rest upon Ezekiel's perception. She did not begrudge him his newfound relationship with the Polish antique dealer. She could simply be happy that he had finally found something to ground him, something to live for instead of something to die for. Hopefully this would curb his recklessness and make him a bit more attentive to the potential harms of an open war.

But Ezekiel's new life in Poland only went so far and he soon steered the conversation back to the reason for his return.

"How go the preparations here. We still on schedule?"

"Indeed. We have the plan for the initial assault all mapped out, as well as several follow up attacks. I think you'll be impressed with what Antonio and his friends have put together. We'll go over the plan with you tomorrow and run some drills, assuming you still want to participate?" She didn't know why she asked, as if there was a world in which Ezekiel wasn't part of the assault squad. "We've worked out the schedule for public relations and a media campaign strategy. It's a good plan and people are excited about it, excited about each of their roles. If anything I worry that they are too excited."

"Don't be too hard on them. You didn't found Emancipación to keep them cooped up here forever. This place always was a training ground for this day." Ezekiel was now handing her additional onions as she finished each.

Vera couldn't argue with that, though she didn't think that was *all* Emancipación was either.

"Go get some rest Ezekiel. We'll need your strength in the days to come."

"As if I could rest at a time like this." Ezekiel did understand he was being dismissed though and made to leave the room, but then paused. "Oh, is Arsène back yet? He said he wanted to talk to me when I returned."

Vera wondered what was meant by this question. One of the abilities of a telekinetic was being able to almost instantly check who was at Emancipación and where they were. And yet Ezekiel had asked her instead.

"Yes, I believe he is with Xinyue in the study, reviewing logistics and contingencies for phase two. Do try to be civil with him. We need to remain focused on the mission at this moment." She set down the knife and turned to look Ezekiel in the eyes.

Ezekiel bowed his head slightly in response. "Hey, Vera. Arsène and me have had our disagreements, but at the end of the day, we're brothers. We have each other's back." This was said surprisingly softly for Ezekiel. Seriously even. "And, look, I know in the past I've critiqued the plan, said that we are pulling our punches, but I get it, the need for restraint. I do. If it had just been me, I would have rushed in blindly and probably done more harm than good. I appreciate you all being the voices of reason." 

Was Ezekiel actually scratching the back of his head while looking down at the floor? Vera was stunned. Maybe Carla really was having a positive effect on him. 

But in the next moment, the normal Ezekiel was back, all smiles and boisterousness. "Doesn't mean Arsène ain't a pansy though!" And with that he was gone from the kitchen, leaving Vera to chuckle to herself and return to preparing dinner. She wanted to do a good job with this meal. It would be one of the last they might all have together.

## Chapter 12 - A Confrontation

*Two weeks before the Proclamation*

Director Harris didn't understand how this was possible. The suppressors for this facility were triply redundant, air-gapped from outside networks, and had both batteries and generators as backup power sources. This facility should be impervious to all Anomaly attacks. And yet, her he was, listening to the suppressor failure alarm and watching his men being torn apart on the displays in his office. Guns, steel doors, and tear gas were proving no match for this mission. These weren't the fumblings of an eruption. These were practiced Anomalies demonstrating their full capacity for violence. Decades of theoretical fears made manifest. Never before had he understood the importance of his job more viscerally. 

He steadied himself and waited for the ax to fall. His job was primarily managerial, administrative, strategic, not field ops. This facility would stand or fall today based on the actions of his security team, not his own. Perhaps the suppressors would come back on. Or someone would reach the vehicle-mounted suppressors in the garage. Harris prayed for this, but he wasn't optimistic. If either were going to happen, it would have happened by now. Instead, he opened the lower drawer on his desk and pulled out his contingency. This was the result of more than $400M in spending. Virtually the HDU's entire R&D budget going back years. And despite that, it was a prototype, not a production model. He had specifically requested one for himself last year, a clear abuse of his authority, but perhaps it had been a presentiment of this very day. Now it was all he had left.

***

Vera practically flew through the hallways, every step impossibly long. She was flanked by Ezekiel and Xinyue, who matched her swiftness, their every motion coordinated through vibrations in the ether. Jackets and hair billowed out behind them, struggling to keep up with those who bore them. Now that they were through the initial defenses, the halls were mercifully empty. She could sense the civilian workers sheltering in place behind the closed doors she flew by. 

The plan was operating amazingly smoothly thus far. Antonio's cyberintrusion campaign had been successful far beyond what they had expected. For all the HDU's defenses against intrusion by telekinetics, their defenses against more conventional forms of espionage and sabotage were quite lacking. Some spearphishing, a flash drive left in the parking lot, and some clever social engineering was all that was required to gain access to the network of HDU HQ. The fruits included a vast trove of reports and documentation, including the locations of every HDU facility on the continent (many, but not all of which were already known to the HDU) as well as several locations of sister agencies elsewhere in the world. Already some of the documentation of kidnapping - ahem, "eruption interventions" - was being prepared for release as part of subsequent phases of the struggle.

The most important result, of course, had been the continuous suppressor machines that protected most of the building. It had been surprisingly easy to figure out how to turn them off and only moderately more difficult to do so without setting off alarms, the first step of the Sodality's attack. The hack did not provide them with *everything* however. Two key elements were missing. First, the laboratory portion of HQ operated on a separate network with substantially better security, for reasons that the telekinetic's couldn't figure out. This means that while they knew the likely general area that the captives were being held and even an estimated count (based on the eruption intervention reports) they did not have a precise number and location. 

The second was that the facility was equipped with a variety of off-network, manually activated suppressor machines. Some of these were the vehicle-based devices used for kidnapping missions. These were all helpfully located together in the garage. Others were clearly intended to be emergency backups for the facility itself and were scattered about. Fortunately the locations of these machines were clearly marked on the maps they had obtained. Unfortunately, HDU HQ was a heavy, brutalist building, clearly built in days of fear of nuclear Armageddon. While some of the machines were located on exterior walls and thus accessible to telekinetics from a decent distance, the vast majority were not. If the Sodality wanted to deactivate those machines, they would have to go in themselves.

The mission thus had two primary objectives: retrieve the captive telekinetics and disable the backup suppressor machines before any HDU officials could reach them. To this end, the team was organized into several squads of three. In each squad, one person would handle forward progress and offensive action. This included tearing down walls as well as disarming and disabling any armed personnel. While Vera and Arsène had won the argument in favor of this mission being nonlethal, broken hands or limbs were deemed acceptable, so long as everyone - including HDU employees - could safely evacuate the building. Another squadmate would focus on defensive action. The third's job was situational awareness and communications with the other squads. 

With practice, which all those participating in the assault had aplenty (including with live fire drills out in the desert), such an organization was an incredible fighting force. The telekinetic language had been adapted for quick combat communication and was far more flexible and rapid than the shouted orders or hand on the shoulder of more conventional forces. The three telekinetics could move incredibly swiftly and cohesively, not as three individuals but as a unified destructive force. Drills and experimentation had found that virtually no mundane opposition could stand in their way.[^30] 

[^30]:They were not invicible, to be clear. All it took was a momentary lapse of attention to let a bullet slip through or exhaustion to cause the team to grind to a halt. And telekinetic defenses could protect against *all* weapons. While conventional small arms fire was trivial to stop, provided one saw it coming, heavier artillery or munitions were still a risk. During planning for this assault, numerous contingencies were planned for, though not all had an adequate response. At one extreme, the possibility of a nuclear-armed, suppressor-equipped hypersonic missile was considered and, in Vera's words, "Well there's fuck all we can do about that." The likelihood of such a weapon existing was deemed low however, and the likelihood the HDU would fire it against their own headquarters still lower, so the mission proceeded as planned.

Assuming they didn't get got in a suppression field, of course. To guard against such an eventuality, each squad was equipped with a handheld radio and handguns. The latter were not truly intended to provide a means of fighting one's way out. When it came to conventional firepower and training, HDU hopeless outmatched the Sodality. Instead, they were intended to ensure the telekinetics had a means of avoiding live capture, which could threaten the Sodality as a whole. Even Arsène, who vehemently refused to carry a firearm, recognized the importance of this and thus had opted to carry a poison pill on his person.

As soon as the continuous suppressors were remotely deactivated, the Sodality leapt into action. Two squads working together, led by Arsène, headed straight for the laboratory to secure the captives. The remaining eight split up and targeted the auxiliary suppressor machines, each taking the most direct route from the exterior, even if that meant going through walls or ceilings. Once the primary objectives were accomplished, secondary objectives could be pursued. This included nabbing whatever digital records from the laboratory were possible (video of torture and other human rights abuses was deemed to be extremely valuable for later phases of the campaign), securing the perimeter against counterattacks led from other HDU facilities, or, in the case of Vera's squad, looking for one person in particular.

Vera wanted to revel in this moment. It was so rare that they - that she - were able to use their powers so freely, so openly. No portion of her mind and energy was being expended on hiding her actions, her very being, from the world. She could stretch her mind out through these walls unafraid. She could enact her will upon the world around her. It was like being released from a straitjacket after all these years. She could feel the ecstasy in Ezekiel and Xinyue too. They were loving this taste of uninhibited liberation for the first time. This was the future that they fought for! The future that was within their reach at long last!

With some effort, Vera reigned herself in. The future was still the future and hadn't been won yet. And becoming power drunk would all too easily transform them into monsters, she knew all too well. People. real people, were fighting and maybe even dying today. Today's assault was necessary, not an expression of vindictive glee. She only hoped that the others remembered this was well. Besides, plans rarely went off without a hitch.

The trio felt the small security unit waiting in the anteroom of the Director's office as they approached. Before they even opened the door, the battle was over. Moaning bodies lay strewn across the floor and desks. Guns and knives lay crumpled into harmless lumps of metal. Vera felt Xinyue's lips flicker upwards into a smile at the sight. It lasted only for an instant before her usual placidity re-exerted itself. Ezekiel meanwhile cast a haughty eye around the scene, seemingly disappointed in the caliber of their foes. Vera's attention remained on the door still before her and on what lay beyond. 

*Will he recognize the destructive futility of this path?* She desperately hoped so. *Please let this end here.* 

She did not feel like an avenging god now. She felt like the tired old woman she was, reenacting the same scene over again. She stepped forward and opened the door.

Behind it lay an antique, wood-paneled office, unusual for a contemporary government official. On the left, a bank of wall-mounted monitors currently showed various alerts and live footage of combat and disarray across the facility. On the right was a large map of the world decorated with various pins, notes, and photos on it. Brightly colored thread connected the objects. A conspiracy theorist's board, but neatly organized. From what she could tell, the subject of the board was her, though Xinyue, Ezekiel, and a few others made an appearance as well. 

Directly before was a large oak desk and behind it sat an older, grey-haired man in a dark blue suit. The very picture of a mid 19th century g-man. Director Frank Harris. 

Vera stepped forward. "Director Harris." It was a statement, not a question. Vera wanted to be clear that she was not operating from a position of ignorance. "We have come to negotiate."

"Is that what you call all this massacre?" Harris asked, gesturing at the wall of monitors with his left hand. He was smiling politely but his eyes shone with a cold fury. Vera was impressed by his lack of fear. She could feel his breathing and heart rate. Both were hardly elevated. Livid not raging.

Vera chose to ignore the question. "As a gesture of good will, we will permit your people to withdraw without further violence. They do not need to disarm, they only need to leave. They may take the injured with them. All you need to do is use your emergency intercom there to issue the stand-down order. Then you and I can discuss a more long-term ceasefire and take the first steps toward a lasting peace." These were generous terms and Vera hoped that they would be accepted as such.

"You want us to meekly surrender?" Harris practically spat the words. All pretense of civility was gone. "I have spent my whole life fighting you and yours. I'll be damned if I just lie down and die."

Vera arched an eyebrow dismissively. "Director Harris has a reputation of being a reasonable, practical man. Not one prone to emotional outbursts and hyperbole. Is this not the man that I am speaking to? Your people can live to fight another day.. You are not committing them to anything. Just tell them to go."

The Director didn't hesitate. "Here's your reasonable practicality, freak," he snarled. He raised his previously hidden right hand from under his desk. Under the florescent lights there was a metallic flash. There was something in his hand. Something that shouldn't, *couldn't* be there. Before Vera or her compatriots could move to stop him, Harris leveled the gun at Vera's chest and pulled the trigger.

A loud crack filled the office. The next moment was a blur of chaotic sense impressions. The smell of smokeless powder burning. A racing wind. Papers from the desk now torn and flying about the room. A cry issuing forth from Ezekiel's lips. The widening of Xinyue's eyes. A loud crash of breaking porcelain and glass. 

Harris was flung against the wall. He elbow was smashed and broken. He right hand crushed beyond recognizability. The gun fell to the ground, next to a a broken lamp and a blood-covered, heavy stone paperweight. Before Xinyue and Ezekiel could snap Harris' neck, a shouted command filled the air: "Stop!" 

Some power gripped theirs' and held it in check. It was Vera who had spoken. It was she who had stopped her friends from ending Harris' life. Xinyue and Ezekiel were astonished, but their surprise paled in comparison to Harris'. Pinned tightly against the wall, moaning from the pain of suddenly broken bones and ligaments, his eyes widened in shock and horror at the figure who remained standing before him.

Vera stood there, unperturbed. Her left side was stained with blood. A quick inspection of her internal autonomy confirmed her guess. A grazing wound, a cracked rib. Unpleasant, but nothing serious. She didn't even need to remove the bullet. She reached across her chest with her right arm and lightly touched the wet patch. Blood stuck to her fingers. She raised her hand to her face and examined the evidence of her mortality. In all these long year, it was the closest that the HDU had ever come to killing her. *Not today,* she thought to herself before returning her attention to the broken and pinned Director.

"It appears that I was misled." She said calmly. "These are not the actions of a reasonable, practical man. These are the actions of a blind zealot. Do you think killing me would stop what is coming? How foolish. I am seeking peace! My death would have only made things so much worse."

Harris stared at the wound on her side in disbelief. "Impossible," he grunted through the pain. "I... aimed true." 

Vera simply shrugged in response. "Perhaps your toys are not as effective as you think they are."

She walked around the desk and retrieved the firearm from the ground, examining it nonchalantly. In truth she was terrified. Her adrenaline-infused heart was racing. She struggled to maintain her confident facade and reign in her thoughts. The gun *had* worked. None of them had been able to sense its presence. They still couldn't. It felt like empty air. When she grasped the rubber grip, her powers vanished, just as Harris himself had vanished from their telekinetic view when he raised the gun.

Nor had they been able to stop, or even sense, the bullet in flight. And the Director's aim had indeed been true. By all rights, there should be a bullethole in her heart right now. She should be dead on the ground, beyond the powers of Roseanne or any other member of the Sodality to save her. Yet again, Vera survived the HDU's best efforts through some stroke of luck. 

If the Director wasn't so panicked, so blinded by adrenaline and pain, he might have noticed the clue presented by the paper still fluttering to the ground beneath the monitors. He might have noticed the odd breeze in the room that had been a gale a moment before. 

When faced with a weapon that she could not sense or touch, Vera had reacted without thinking. As Xinyue had hurled the paper weight at Harris' hand and Ezekiel had flung the desk lamp at his elbow, Vera had thrown every ounce of her power into moving the very air itself before her, slashing from right to left. A hurricane force wind had arisen instantly and deflected the bullet en route just enough to avoid a fatal injury. 

*How many of these guns exist?* Vera suppressed a shudder. *How easily our advantage might vanish. We must act quickly now, while we still have a chance.* She pushed such fears from her mind. They could regroup and adjust their plans in response to this revelation later. She flicked the safety on the gun and set it on the desk while she took off her jacket and tied it into a sack of sorts. She deposited the horrid thing into her sack. *There, that seems to provide enough distance to avoid the suppression.* Then she turned back to Harris and leaned in close to his face.

She spoke quietly but with the surety of death itself. She asked no questions, issued no demands. She simply state the truth. "Your life is now forfeit. You know that. We must now bring our suit to other authorities. But your people may yet live. You will order them to stand down, disarm, and withdraw."

The wild mix of terror, rage, and pain in Harris' eyes gave way to a focused determination. Here was the Director again. The cornered animal was gone. "Yes," he responded, somehow managing a tone of concurrence rather than defeat or resignation.

The invisible hands binding Harris to the wall slackened slightly, then drew him to his desk and placed him down in his seat. He left arm was released. He awkwardly reached his nondominant hand over to the emergency intercom button, grimaces flashing across his worn face as every movement inflamed the pain in his destroyed arm.

"This is Director Harris. All HDU personnel are to stand down, drop your weapons, and evacuate the facility. Do not interfere with the intruders." Harris repeated the directive twice more for clarity. Then he added an addendum. "This is not over. We will live to continue our fight against this danger. We will protect our nation and our world. God bless you all and God bless America."

Xinyue had moved to halt the expression of patriotic defiance, but a command from Vera over their invisible connection halted her. Let him speak. Vera was sick of today's violence. Her mind had already moved on. She had doubted this little show of force would be sufficient but thought it worth the chance, hoped that Harris would prove willing to negotiate. But despite his veneer of pragmatism and gentility, he was as closed minded and zealotrous as one might expect of the head of the HDU. No, there was no negotiating with this would-be martyr. Now it was time to depart, before reinforcements from other HDU facilities arrived with working suppressors. But Harris would be coming with them. He still had a role to play.

***

As the three exited the office, their hostage floating helplessly between them. Vera's eyes fell on one of the pages that had fluttered to the ground. On it was a photo of her from just a few weeks before her awakening. She was so young, so blessedly ignorant of the struggle that was to consume her life. The photo was cropped to just show her face, but the original image swam up out of her memory. It was her and three other residents of the student co-op that she had lived in. They were smiling and laughing over the kitchen island counter, rolling out dough for baking sourbread. Vera realized that she couldn't remember the name of the co-op nor those of two of three other students. The third she did remember. Delilah. 

The pain in her wounded side recalled her to the present. The ghosts of the past, of a could-have-been life, were just that, ghosts. She had problems of flesh and blood to worry about. Vera turned and strode out of the room.

***

Harris' bullet may not have slain Vera, but it did have other consequences that day.

It was Xinyue who recognized the disturbing possibility first, as the three moved down a corridor, prisoner in tow. Ezekiel likely missed it while reveling in their victory over the Director. And Vera, despite her cool facade, was indeed quite unnerved by her close brush with death and not as doggedly analytical as she typically was.

*"If there's one gun like that, there could be more."* This was said silently, via telekinetic signalling to avoid alerting the captive Director. 

All three stopped moving. Vera's eyes widened in shocked epiphany, her mind frantically sketching out potentialities. Xinyue was there already though, communicating the risk to all the members of Sodality in and around the HDU headquarters and explaining what to look for in order to keep themselves safe. 

*"Not just to keep ourselves safe,"* said Ezekiel to all the telekinetics, *"We need to identify the lab that they are making these in and destroy it, along with everyone who worked on them."*

At this last clause, Arsène responded in alarm, *"No! We decided to do this without bloodshed.*

*"That was before we knew that they had this!"* Ezekiel retorted. *"If they are able to produce these at scale, we are well and truly fucked. We need to nip this in the bud now before we lose what advantage we have.*

*"Even with the element of surprise, that gun failed to kill Vera Kelly! Now that we know about them, we can prepare for them. We can do that without murder!"*

*"Maybe we can prepare for handguns, but this won't stop there. What about when they develop a sniper rifle or a cruise missile or a fucking nuke that we can't see coming!"*

The argument between Ezekiel and Arsène continued in this way while Vera considered her options. She was shaken, off balance, and desperately trying to collect herself before things spiraled out of control. She looked at the suspended Director, who was no doubt wondering why their progress had been halted. But he remained sullenly silent and just stared daggers at his captor. There was no point in trying to interrogate him here and now. 

Next she looked to Xinyue who met her gaze. Vera could feel Xinyue closely monitoring their surroundings, the progress of the Sodality in all their assigned tasks, all while keeping the Director tightly bound. What attention she had remaining was directed at Vera now. In that gaze was trust and confidence, but not advice. Xinyue would follow Vera's lead here. But Vera had to make the decision herself. 

She turned her attention to the broader situation. At this point, sufficient interior and exterior walls had been demolished to enable communication across the building, though doing much more than that at a distance would be difficult. Arsène,  Ameera, and Lucas had found the imprisoned novitiates, three of them -*Oh God, that means they killed all the others* - , and were on their way out. Most of the HDU employees were following Harris' order to stand down and retreat. Only a few recalcitrants remained and they were being systematically disarmed and disabled by the group led Roseanne's group, which included Akin and Damián. Meanwhile Antonio, Tillie, and Andrea were still busy in the server room, studiously focused on their task and clearly doing their best to ignore the ongoing argument. Several other members of the Sodality were wordlessly signaling which side they were on. Ameera and Aubrey were siding with Arsène. Akin and Flora with Ezekiel. Roseanne, with what additional attention she had available, was examining Vera's wound. It was roughly evenly divided, though most remained silent. Vera gave Lucas a gentle, querying nudge. 

*"Leave me out of it,"* Lucas snapped impatiently. *"This is my priority here."* 

He meant caring for the captives whom he had not that long ago been among. She briefly pondered what whirlwind of emotions he was experiencing at this moment. No, she couldn't rely on Lucas to make this decision. Vera took a moment to weight her options before tuning back into the still ongoing argument.

*"-to be better than them!* Arsène was saying, even as he assisted Ameera and Lucas with guiding the novitiates out of the building. Vera interjected before Ezekiel could respond.

*"Enough."* It was not said angrily or forcefully, but she could feel everyone's attention snap to her. *"Antonio. Tillie. How goes the exfiltration?*

*"We've just about identified all the hard drives we want."* Tillie responded while Antonio furiously scribbled notes down on legal paper, making some kind of checklist while reading text on a computer monitor. *"The IT staff here caved pretty easily so we have all the passwords we need. Give us another...*" She glanced at her partner in crime. Without looking up he held up one hand, all five digits splayed widely. *"...five minutes and we will have all this packed up and on its way out of here."*

*"Very well,"* Vera acknowledged. *"The situation has changed. Flora and Julian, you are to evacuate all of the injured and disabled from the building. Roseanne continue pacifying anyone who hasn't surrendered yet. The rest of you now report to Ezekiel. Ezekiel, get to the lab and find anyone who works in it. Grab anything that seems useful, then destroy the lab. No, not destroy. I want you to unmake it. I want it to have never have existed. I don't want anything intact, anything left that could be put back together even with an army and billions of dollars. Once, everyone is out, we are pulling down the walls on this place.*

Arsène and Ezekiel spoke up simultaneously, both asking, in their own words, "And what do we do when we find the engineers who made that gun?"

*"If anyone identifies them, notify me and I will speak to them."* Vera could tell that this noncommittal answer satisfied neither person, but neither voiced any dissent. *"Now go."*

It was surprisingly easy to identify the suppressed weapons, once they started looking for them. It was just a matter of shifting one's perspective. One simply had to look for what *wasn't* there rather than what was. While this took some effort not dissimilar to crossing one's eyes, once done it was sudden flip, like the sudden transition of an optical illusion from rabbit to a duck. Then it was hard to see how one didn't notice what was right before your eyes. 

In this way the specific lab that originated the guns was clearly evident, with prototypes and components lay scattered on workbenches and in drawers, all small voids in the Sodality's telekinetic awareness. Once found, it was a simple matter to trace the path of the obvious escape route through the building to find a cluster of six person-sized, irregularly shaped voids bringing up the rear of fleeing train of HDU employees. Ezekiel and his unit moved at once to the lab. Vera hurried towards the scientists, sending mental warnings to her compatriots to steer clear. She had barely managed to deflect one bullet from these guns. She didn't want anyone to try deflecting six.

As she flew towards the scientists, Vera felt none of the exhilaration of her approach towards the Director's office. The adrenaline was wearing off and the wound in her side, previously a dull ache, was now like a flaming brand. Her mind was struggling to grapple with the dilemma that awaited her. She was confident she could disarm the six, even if she couldn't act directly on the guns themselves, though it might involve injuring those that bore them. But what then? Let them go, with their knowledge of how to make guns that the Sodality couldn't stop, couldn't even see without already knowing they were there? Or kill again, something she had no desire to do? Her thoughts kept sliding back to her previous murders, for that's what they were in her mind, murders. She had to repeatedly keep wrenching her focus back to the present, to deal with the issue at hand. 

She still hadn't reached a decision when she reached her destination. Before she was in line of sight, she mentally reached out, grabbed the several people in front of her targets, and shoved them swiftly forward, sending them tumbling through the air. At the same moment, she brought down the ceiling of the hallway behind them, isolating the armed lab researchers. Those six leapt backwards from the following debris, a brief chorus of shouts and screams erupting from the cluster. After a moment, they turned back to try and found another way only to see Vera standing some ten meters behind them, blocking their only escape route. 

Vera studied them. They were all engineers and scientists to be sure. White lab coats worn over jeans and a mix of t-shirts and flannel. The youngest was a beardless young man with shaggy hair who hardly looked like he was out of grad school. Maybe he wasn't. The eldest and apparent leader was an older woman with short, white hair. She was short and someone stout, with an appraising intelligence in her eye. While the rest of the band ranged from scared to terrified, this woman seemed unfazed by the sudden and violent halt to their departure. She simply stood and evaluated Vera, apparently trying to determine her exact position in this interaction, figure out exactly what Vera did and did not know.

The youngest meanwhile was also skittish, his hand twitching, clearly considering reaching for the gun under his lab coat. Vera needed to head that off before this devolved. She looked him dead in the eye.

"I wouldn't do that. You saw what I did to the hallway. Do you think you can draw that gun and shoot me before I bring down the hallway on you head? On *all* your heads?"

The target of her ire dropped his head, his hand falling limp. The silent standoff having been broken prompted the older woman to speak up.

"I am the lead researcher of the Tele-Suppression Munition Program. I take full responsibility."

Vera considered her coldly. "You were told to stand down and evacuate. And yet you are still armed."

"I ordered them to carry the prototypes out. As I said, I take full responsibility. Please let them go."

"And yet you are still armed." Vera repeated the sentence with the exact same intonation, as if the lead researcher hadn't said anything.

The researcher studied Vera for several long seconds. Vera's tone and expression offered her no surety, hardly any information at all. What happened next would be a gamble to be sure. Finally, she sighed. "Okay, everyone. Put the prototypes on the ground."

Evidently all five of her subordinates trusted her deeply as there was little hesitation. They each opened their labcoats and slowly drew the handguns out of pockets and waistbands. This was the risky part for Vera. Would one try to turn a gun towards her and pull the trigger? Vera's mundane senses were focused on the scene before her. Every iota of will stored and ready to act. 

But nothing happened. The guns were gently placed on the ground without incident, each one making a gentle clinking noise as they came to rest on the tile floor.

"Slide them towards me."

Her command was obeyed, one gun at a time to avoid colliding with one another. Vera gently sidestepped the fourth that came a little too close. She didn't want to lose her powers, however momentarily, through contact with one of the guns. She could feel Arsène's tense hope transitioning into relief with each moment. Surely this careful disarmament meant she would spare the researchers. She could feel Ezekiel's building anger at the same realization. She could feel it over the noise of the destruction he and his group were wreaking on the lab these researchers were fleeing. Thorough didn't begin to describe his work.

"What reassurances can you offer me that you will not recreate these devices?"

"Nothing but words." The answer was brutally direct and was delivered in such a manner. It almost made Vera smile. She appreciated the honesty.

Vera closed her eyes, breathed deep, and turned her attention inwards. This was a momentous decision and she did not want to make it rashly. Did she want yet more blood on her hands? Did she want to set such an example for the Sodality, that such problems were to be solved by klling? But then did she want to risk the very lives of the Sodality, of those she considered family? Letting these researchers go could very well damn them all. She thought back to those final words of that so-called negotiator all those years ago, the venom in his eyes and voice. She thought too to the fury of the Director, the real man under the veil of pragmatism and professionalism and reasonableness. Perhaps violence was the only solution to such fear and hate. But Arsène still believed there was another way out. And Lucas, the one with the most reason to return hate upon the hateful, had refused to condemn his one-time oppressors, instead focusing on rescuing those who needed it. She could feel the eyes of the entire Sodality upon her now.

She pondered this and much else for a long while. The engineers and scientists stood anxiously, shifting their weight uneasily, unsure of what to make of the closed eyes and concentrating face before them. Finally Vera opened her eyes, the slight motion startling the researchers upright. Then she nodded faintly. The meaning of this gesture was unclear, but the researchers interpreted it as an expression of mercy. They relaxed and sighed audibly as pent up breathes exited their lungs. Their leader closed her eyes in relief. 

And then Vera snapped all of their necks. The six bodies crumpled to the floor in unison. Every member of the Sodality felt it, with the exception of Lucas, who even now was tending to the rescued, his awareness withdrawn from the scene. Ezekiel crowed in triumph and vengeance satisfied, his efforts on shredding the lab beyond recognition redoubled.  Arsène let out a shout, both spoken and mentally projected, a simple "No!" as he fell to his knees.

Vera merely used her telekinesis to retrieve a trashbag from a nearby office. She transferred her jacket, still bearing the Director's gun into the bag. Then she bent down and stuffed each of the six prototype guns in the bag, tied it shut, and began walking towards the exit of the building. She felt many conflicting emotions under the stony expression she maintained. Doubt, regret, relief, justification, and more. She did not know whether she had made the correct choice today. She did know one thing, however. For the first time, she was not crying after killing someone. And she hated herself for that.


## Chapter 13 - The Proclamation

*Five minutes before the Proclamation*

The van bounced along the streets of the Hague. In the dimly lit back of the vehicle seven people - one of them hooded, bound, and gagged - sat on benches along the walls. Each was both nervous and expressing it in their own way. Xinyue alternated between snapping the spare hair tie she kept on her wrist and fiddling with the hand radio. Ezekiel kept tapping his foot and glancing at his watch. Antonio had his eyes glued to the map on his laptop, constantly tracking their location. Arsène had his eyes closed and was muttering under his breath though whether it was religious or secular in nature was impossible to tell. The prisoner, Director Harris kept squirming around and would do a sort of little half jump every time they hit a speed bump. His arm and hand were encased in a thick cast, Roseanne's handiwork, but otherwise he was in fine physical condition. Ameera, seemingly the most relaxed of the bunch, was reading a small book of poetry by Dessa (that belonged to Xinyue). Only Vera had enough wherewithal to notice, however, that she had been stuck on the same page for the entirety of the drive.

Vera was flipping through a short packet of papers, the script for her upcoming role, though her attention was on essentially everything that *wasn't* the script. In addition to noticing Ameera's lack of progress, she was thinking back over the past two weeks. It had been a hectic time, to be sure, as the Sodality began embarking on their multi-phase public awareness campaign. Minutes after the team had finished tearing down HDU headquarters and fled the scene, some other members of the Sodality began posting previously exfiltrated documents online and submitting them to news outlets around the world. These had gotten little attention, except from some of the more conspiracy minded corners of the Internet.

Others had began showing up in person at notable busy sites around the world: the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, the Forbidden City in Bejing, the Taj Mahal in Agra, Trafalgar Square in London, Balogun Market in Lagos, Times Square in New York City, Paulista Avenue in  São Paulo,[^31] and many other locations. They would demonstrate their abilities to move objects at a distance, identify what was hidden in people's pockets, and, most notably, fly. These demonstrations had to be kept brief, typically less than half an hour, in order to avoid running afoul of the HDU or local equivalent, but resulted in much more attention, as locals and tourists alike took to sharing videos and witness testimony. While various officials were no doubt frantically screaming behind closed doors, the public at large seemed to view these as some kind of elaborate hoax, perhaps a viral marketing campaign for a soon-to-be announced movie. Still, the number of believers was increasing and they were starting to ask pointed questions of the powers that be. Vera had not participated in these demonstrations, as the decision had been made to keep her out of the limelight until today.

[^31]: Originally the chosen location for Brazil was Cristo Redentor in Rio de Janeiro, but this was nixed to avoid the telekinetics being seen as either aligned with or mocking Christinaity. 

Only a few days prior, a third approach had begun: releasing videos of cruel experiments - torture really - obtained from the HDU laboratory. The Sodality elected to not release video of any of the three survivors that had been rescued (Emily, Trinh, and Paul). They had suffered far to much to warrant another insult to their dignity. Tragically, there was no lack of footage of telekinetics who had not survived. It was these videos that the Sodality began releasing online. Many platforms immediately tried taking them down due to their graphic nature, but people began sharing them widely. People were still asking "Is this real?" but now the tone was shifting from skepticism and amusement to fear and outrage. 

Throughout all of this, the Sodality had provided virtually no information about itself. No explanations or demands. For now evidence of telekinetics' existence and their oppression was allowed to stand on its own. The Sodality wanted to make sure that when they were ready to speak, everyone would be listening. It was Vera's job to have something to say. This reminded her to look over the script again and go through another mental rehearsal. 

It took only moments for her mind to slide back to the topic that had consumed most of her (all too scarce) quiet moments these past two weeks. Not any of the uncertain future that is to come. Not any of the public outreach. But the event that immediately preceded, her slaying of the HDU scientists. She had turned away from violence to raise up the Sodality. She had committed her life to saving others. And now she had killed again. Was this a betrayal? Or simply a necessary extension of her mission to save telekinetics, her people, her family? She wasn't sure. She also wasn't sure how this act would affect the Sodality. Arsène obviously resented the act, though he remained committed to the community and the mission. Arsène wasn't alone either. She had never advocated violence to those she had rescued. In fact she used her stories from her past as cautionary tales, as evidence of the futility of fighting a war alone. *But was the problem the fighting or the doing it alone?*

"Where about five minutes out now," said Antonio, breaking the silence, eagerness evident in his voice. "We'll be coming around the Hofvijver shortly." 

Ameera's eyes flicked up at the awkward pronunciation of the pond's name, then swiftly returned to her poem. Vera sighed. *Enlightenment will have to wait.*

"Let's go around the horn," The primary tone in Xinyue's voice was relief. She was happy to have something productive to do. She brought the radio to her mouth. No one was using their powers right now. They didn't want to give the ODA, the western European equivalent of the HDU, a head start.  "Status check. External cameras?"

Akin's voice crackled back over the radio. "We're in position, ready to go live at your command." 

"Evac?" 

"Ready. We'll deploy at your signal." This was Roseanne's voice.

"Perimeter?"

A count off by several voices ensued.

Xinyue dropped the radio to her lap. "Internal camera?"

Arsène opened his eyes and spoke with careful deliberateness. "Ready." He held up the camera as proof.

"Distribution?"

Antonio nodded. "All good on my front."

"Prisoner transportation?"

"I got him." Ezekiel rolled his shoulders and stretched his arms.

"Translation?"

Ameera closed the book. "Ready, yes."

"Speech?"

Vera folded up the script and tucked it into an internal pock of her long coat. She had not wanted this role. Why not Arsène, who had the most experience with political mobilization? Or Flora, who had, during community theater performances at Emancipación, demonstrated an ability to extract tears from a stone? Or Ezekiel, a large, well-built white man likely to be taken seriously on the world stage? But virtually everyone, including two of those three, had insisted that it had to be her. She was their leader. She had talked more of them into joining the Sodality than anyone else. She was the only one who could potentially talk the world into accepting them.

And so here she was, a memorized speech rattling around in her brain. "Ready."

Xinyue brought the radio back up. "Everyone is ready. Stand by for my command."

"We're pulling up to the west entrance now!" Flora called from the front of the van. "Thirty seconds."

*Let's not fuck this up.* Vera thought to herself as the van slowed to  a stop.

"We're here," said Flora.

"Alright then." Xinyue took a breath, brought the radio to her mouth and spoke. "Go, go, go!"

The back doors of the van flew open and Vera, Ameera, Ezekiel, Arsène swiftly exited, Director Harris floating in tow behind them. As soon as they were out, the doors doors slammed shut and vehicle pulled away back into traffic. Vera took the lead heading towards the arched gate of the entrance to the Netherlands parliamentary building. Her gait had the appearance of walking but she was covering ground surprisingly fast for her apparent level of relaxation. Her long coat fluttered around her legs with the movement. She and her compatriots were clad in attire of contemporary political elites, a variation on the centuries old suit and tie, though the most recent generation had elongated the jackets down past the knees. The one sartorial element that set them apart from some legislator or government minister was the fact that their suits were not in one of the classic greys, blues, or blacks. Instead they were all a deep maroon. This costume had been Aubrey's idea, a way of looking serious (and thus hopefully being taken seriously) while still standing out, since telekinetics were not simply another political faction but something new.

Almost immediately, shouts of concern and alarm sprang up from pedestrians. It is not everyday that one sees what looks to be a government official, bound and gagged (the hood had been removed as they exited the vehicle). Even less often does one see such a person floating above the pavement. Vera largely ignored the reaction, only intervening with the occasional individual who froze in their path out of surprise or fear. These she gently slid out of the way with her mind. This often prompted a scream out of the affected individual, which was duly ignored by the focused telekinetics. 

As they passed through the gate, Vera disarmed the advancing guards and similarly moved them out of the way but took no other action. Let them "Stop!" and "Halt!" to their hearts' content. Arsène by now had his camera up and recording. 

"We are receiving both camera feeds." This was Xinyue, signalling over their telekinetic link, now that subtly was in the rearview mirror. "We will go live as soon as you enter the chamber."

"Roger that," Arsène signaled back. Vera said nothing, her focus on the job ahead of her.

They met no meaningful opposition on their way to the Dutch House of Representatives, who were even now in session. The four telekinetics left behind a trail of mangled guns and indignant guards. They did not stop to talk or reason. This venue had been chosen for several reasons, one is that the ODA had a base just outside of the Hague. A consequence of this however was that they had little time to spare.

Vera walked determinedly to the doors of the legislative chamber, which swung open before her. Only as she crossed the threshold did she slow to a more leisurely pace. The legislators had clearly been given some warning of the intrusion, as many of them were already standing, perhaps preparing to evacuate.

"Please be seated," Vera called out calmly as she strode down the stairs that bisected the room.  Director Harris floated just after her. Some of the assemblage present followed her directive but Vera made no attempt to enforce her will upon those that remained standing. "We will only take a few minutes of your time." Ameera, stepping into the room just behind Harris, loudly repeated both sentences in Dutch. Then Ezekiel and Arsène entered the room, using their powers to close the doors firmly behind them. Simultaneously the emergency exits, through which several legislators were even now attempted to flee, slammed shut. The pair remained in front of the main door, signaling that the entrance was blocked. Arsène kept the camera focused on Vera, though with a wide enough perspective to capture a good portion of the chamber.

As murmurs and protestations echoed, Vera crossed the center of the chamber and stepped up onto the fair side. The chamber lacked any kind of central podium, instead having two angled banks of chairs that faced the bulk of the legislature. Vera stood between these banks and turned to face her audience. Harris drifted over behind her and slightly to one side. Ameera stepped up and stood on her other side.

"Over the past two weeks, you have no doubt heard the rumors and seen the videos. Humans with strange, frightening abilities. Torture committed by government scientists. I am here to confirm those rumors. The allegations are true. We exist. We have existed for perhaps a century now. I cannot be precise because during that time we have been systematically hunted, captured, tortured, and killed. We only have the records of some of our oppressors, recently obtained by us in our first act of liberation."

All of this was spoken deliberately slowly, with sufficient pauses between clauses and sentences to allow Ameera to translate into Dutch. Vera had proposed that Ameera deliver the speech for this very reason, but Xinyue had patiently pointed out that their audience was much larger than the Dutch legislature. Vera had to concede the point.

*Evac route is secure.* This was Roseanne, directed primarily at Ezekiel, but all of Vera's senses were alive at the moment and she, as intent upon the speech as she was, she realized that she had been subconciously monitoring the entire area. To just herself she thought, *The last time I set myself up as bait it ended horrifically. No wonder I'm so on edge. This time I have a full team though.* She took comfort in that thought and turned her attention back to her own task.

"That oppression is why I stand before you today. We call ourselves telekinetics. My name is Vera Kelly. I was born in the United States of America and have spent most of my life on the run. I have been elected, much as the Dutch people elected you, to speak on our behalf. We are here to claim our rights as human beings, as fellow citizens of this world." Despite the long hours of practicing this speech, Vera felt genuine passion and righteous indignation welling up inside her as she spoke these words. She was so taken by the experience that she was quite surprised when someone interrupted her.

"Why do you bring this to us?" This came from an older man, balding and wearing thick glasses, but clearly not without vigor. He had said this in English, rather than Dutch, and he remained standing, defiant.  Ezekiel almost mentally reached out to shove him down into his seat, but Arsène did the telekinetic equivalent of a tap on the shoulder.

*Hold, brother. Trust Vera to handle this.* Ezekiel stilled.

Almost simultaneously, another telekinetic signal came racing into the room. *This is Perimeter Bravo, Dutch policy and military are approaching. Expect them to surround the Binnenhof in a matter of minutes.*

All was going according to plan. Vera let the silence linger for a moment as she evaluator her new interlocutor. She would have to make some improvisations. *Well, we practiced for this.* "Your country - this city - houses the International Criminal Court. I come bearing one of the chief architects of our oppression, someone directly responsible for the atrocities we have shown to the world."

"You are American! He is American!" The old representative jabbed his finger first towards Vera then towards Harris. He would not be deterred so easily. "The United States has never never recognized the court's authority. And we represent the Dutch, not the world!"

Vera's gaze turned icy. "Do you think we do not know this? As of today, we live in a new era, one the wisdom of our laws and our forebears did not anticipate. I do not come to speak to you of legal technicalities! I am here to appeal to your basic human dignity and your own good sense!" This seemed to cow the man as he lowered his gaze but still remained standing.

"Just because our first strike in America, are you so naïve to think this is an American problem? That you could stand aside and hope this war - and *it is a war* -  wouldn't reach your shores? Ameera here is a Dutch citizen. She discovered her powers not a hundred kilometers from where we stand. And still, she would have faced the same fate as countless before her if we hadn't intervened. There is a facility housing our oppressors fifteen kilometers from here." Vera found herself gesturing in the directions of this geographic references. "Even now, they are no doubt heading here to drag us away to some dark hole to stick us full of needles and tubes until we die pathetic, anonymous, unmourned deaths. Many of those men are Dutch citizens. Their salaries are paid with Dutch taxes. The equipment they carry was purchased with the approval of this legislature." 

A mix of concern, confusion, and outrage erupted from the assembly. The last of these was uncertain, wavering, not sure whether to be directed at Vera or at the acts she was alleging. Vera gave it a moment to vent before proceeding. She did not inform her audience that this proximity was one of the reasons the Sodality had selected the States General of the Netherlands for this spectacle. Part of the motivation for the past two weeks' activity was to scare every member global network that suppressed telekinetics. The Sodality wanted their enemies to be jumpy, frightened of their own shadows. Because nervous men with guns make mistakes.

"I did not come here to accuse you. You did not know. Our oppressors operate in the shadows. They have fed you and your people lies for decades. And it is not you alone. Today we have come to drag them into the light. As I speak, we are releasing lists of just some of the locations that house our oppressors. Some are used as staging areas. Others are used to imprison and torture telekinetics. Almost all are formal parts of their nation's government. You will see that virtually every nation on this planet is complicit in these atrocities."

The legislators had quieted by now. They didn't fully believe her, not yet, but she was making progress. *Time to give them a positive course.*

"I came here today to offer you, to offer all nations of the world, a choice. You can abolish these shadowy organizations dedicated to our destruction. You can pass laws protecting our God-given human rights. We can benefit by working together. We can collaborate with your scientists to understand our powers and how they might be leveraged to benefit society. We can work with you to develop protections against the abuse of telekinesis. We can return to the family and friends we had to abandon in order to protect both them and us. We can have a harmony and peace founded on mutual understanding rather than on illicit kidnappings and torture."

She couldn't stop here, of course, as much as Arsène might wish. For all their lofty rhetoric, the governments of the world were all too willing to turn a blind eye towards the oppressor of someone marginal group. They had to know there would be consequences for shirking their responsibilities. 

"Or you can choose war. I choose that word deliberately. War. We refuse to hide and wait to be hunted down any longer. Two weeks ago, we fought back. We will continue to fight back against all those who oppress us or harbor our oppressors. We will destroy all those who seek to kidnap and imprison us. And we will win. This is our declaration of intent, our proclamation to the world, our promise to each and every one of you."[^32] 

[^32]: It is from this sentence that the speech as a whole came to be known: the "Telekinetics' Proclamation", the "Proclamation of 2051", the "April Proclamation", or, most often, simply "The Proclamation". For the remainder of her life, Vera viewed this naming with a sort of wry bemusement. It had been such a minor line during the writing process and both "declaration" and "promise" where sitting right there in the same sentence. But, as they say, history is written by neither the winners or the losers. It is written by the historians.

*Perimeter Echo here, we got ODA convoy approaching from the southeast. Time for y'all to wrap it up in there.* 

Ezekiel acknowledged receipt and gave a hand sign to Vera, just in case she had missed the message. She gave a curt nod but pressed on, speaking with all the fervor of the committed revolutionary that she had become or perhaps, had always been. "Peace or war, the choice is yours, but either way, we will be free."

Once again, Vera let silence emphasize her words. Now she turned to look directly at Arsène's camera. 

"Peoples of the world, we will be watching for your choices in the coming weeks. You can start with the list of locations we have published. Don't dawdle." Now she turned back to the Dutch House of Representatives. "And to you, my friends, we will leave you with a more immediate choice: What will you do with this man?" As she spoke, Director Harris floated out to the center of the room and was laid upon the floor. Released of his telekinetic strictures but still bound by more mundane means, he began squirming on the floor rather pathetically.

Vera and Ameera began striding back across the room to the door, which Ezekiel mentally opened before them. As she strode up the stairs and out of the chamber, Vera let loose a fair well, "Thank you for your time and hospitality. I hope the next time we meet, we meet as friends." Then she was out the door, her three comrades following closely behind her.

***

The conclusion of Vera's speech was none too soon. After leaving the chamber, the squad had swiftly headed up to the building's rooftop. They made their way over the jumbled rooftops of the government complex, staying low and relying upon telekinetically assisted jumps rather than flight, lest they get caught midair when the ODA's suppressors activated. This provided wise when, upon reaching the edge of the complex and leaping across Lange Poten street, the suppressors turned on just before they landed on the next rooftop. 

As a result they landed a bit hard, but all four were able to proceed. The perimeter squad had kept the rooftops clear of soldiers and those occupying the street below had been too surprised by the leaping figures to get any shots off. Now shouts and orders echoed up from the ground level. They quickly made their way across a series of connected rooftops to a zipline that Roseanne's squad had installed across another street. They proceeded southeast in this way, zipline to zipline, until out of range of the suppressor machines. Then they simply dove off the building into one of ancient canals that had only recently been reopened and were gone.

***

The Sodality left behind more than Director Harris however. Several cameras were installed on rooftops looking down at the entrances of the Binnenhof, all streaming remotely to Antonio's mobile command center. In each of them could be seen an interior perimeter made up of police and military and an exterior perimeter of the unmarked vehicles of the ODA. When the black-clad ODA agents tried to pass through the interior perimeter, arguments and scuffles ensued. Some escalated to the point of ODA agents being shoved to the ground and handcuffed. Guns are pointed and a stand-off ensues.

Eventually, the leader of the ODA task force was able to find the commander of the military unit. They were still arguing over the situation when the Prime Minister exited the building, though he remained standing in front of the door. Soldiers escorted both the ODA and military commander over. One of the cameras captured the ensuing interaction, though what precisely was said cannot be discerned. 

In that footage, the ODA lead can be seen gesturing at the building. The Prime Minister shakes his head and responds calmly. The ODA lead is evidently displeased by this response and begins yelling. The Prime Minister ignores the tantrum and turns to the military commander. After a brief exchange, the military commander issues an order. Almost immediately soldiers shove the ODA lead to the ground. 

Over the course of the following minutes, the soldiers swarm, disarm, and restrain those ODA agents not involved in the stand-off. The rest, seeing which way the wind is blowing, back into their vehicles and drive away. Soldiers begin loading to vehicles of their own to pursue. Other soldiers enter the Binnenhof from all sides. Soon, one set of soldiers emerges from the building with Director Harris in tow. His gag has been removed and he is no longer bound, though he is clearly not free to go either. He his escorted over to a delegation from the National Police Corps. The police officers handcuffed Harris, place him in a vehicle, and drive him away.

## Chapter 14 - A Blitz

*One week after the Proclamation*

When Lauren Gonzalez arrived at work in downtown New York, it was still dark outside. Dawn was hours away yet. She had an empty thermos in one hand, having finished her first cup of coffee (a double shot) of the day on the subway. Her first stop of the day would be the breakroom for yet more coffee. She was exhausted by the whirlwind of that had been her past few weeks, but it was a pleasant, exhilarating kind of exhaustion. She was in her element.

Lauren was an investigative journalist and professional interviewer at a major television news company. She lived for uncovering some secret that no one else had found or prompting a person to learn something about themselves. In general, she loved talking to people and people loved talking to her. She honestly thought just about everyone on this planet could be interesting if you just gave them a chance to tell their story. Most of her adult life had been lived on a minimum of sleep and a maximum of caffeine. Even so, the past few weeks had been a bit much.

The elevator doors opened and she strode across the newsroom floor, all cubicles and clattering keyboards. If you added in a haze of smoke, it could have been like any newsroom from the past century or more. The company operated twenty-four-seven, so she was far from the first one there this morning. As she navigated the aisles towards the breakroom, various colleagues approached her with tidbits and leads. She grunted and gestured with her thermos, making it clear that she was in no fit state for conversation at the moment. All the same, she mentally filled away each of their offerings as "I already knew that", "irrelevant", "fake", or, rarest of all, "worth following up on."

She had been reporting on the telekinetics before the Proclamation, as her industry had already taken to calling it. She had spent long hours combing through documents, videos, and witness accounts, trying to sort out truth from falsehood. As far as she could tell, everything the telekinetics had put out had been real. There really had been an attack of some kind at Fort Meade, though the military had tried to keep it hush hush. The leaked documents and videos showed no sign of tampering or editing. The problem was, almost immediately, there were countless copycats. It was non-trivial to sort differentiate the two, particularly when it came to videos of the public demonstrations the telekinetics had been putting on around the world.

One thing became clear almost immediately. Anyone saying that they were a telekinetic and providing a name was full of shit. Prior to the Proclamation, no genuine telekinetic had identified themselves by name. They put on a show, they chatted with the audience (if the audience was friendly), and they departed. If she wanted to track them down - which she desperately did - she would have to do it herself.

And so she combed through the videos for anything identifying, anything that could narrow down where a person was from: accents, slang, visible tattoos. She had reached out to linguists and other experts to assist. But she had made only limited progress in this way. One them was definitely from in or around Abuja, but with a metropolitan area population of almost two million, that was hardly any help. A few were definitely Mexican and some more American.

If this had happened a decade ago, she might have made more progress with facial recognition software. But privacy laws in recent years had significantly restricted their capabilities. Even so she had expected to find more than she had. Only one real lead thus far.

Arriving at the breakroom, she was pleasantly surprised to find that someone had recently made a fresh pot of pour over. *God bless you, friend.* She poured most of the pot into her thermos and then leaned back against the counter, sipping the hot beverage and reviewing the situation.

She had returned to New York City late last night from following that lead. She had taken the train out to Philly to see if she could find one Matilda Henderson, known to her friends as Tillie. Ms. Henderson, and Lauren was virtually positive that is was her, had conducted three public demonstrations in recent weeks, all in the U.S. or Canada. At one of these, in Denver, while engaging in idle banter with the crowd, someone had shouted up to her, "Hey, what did you think of last night's game?"

Ms. Henderson, floating unnervingly in the air at the time, had laughed and replied, "Man, fuck the Cowboys!" 

Lauren couldn't believe how invaluable such an inane question had been. She had immediately run a facial recognition search of social media in each city that had a major rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys. And bingo, some photos that tagged Ms. Henderson (who herself had no active social media accounts)!

Unfortunately the trip had been less than fruitful. Ms. Henderson's parents and younger sister had "moved away" just a week ago. To where, she had no idea. Friends had been unwilling to speak to her or even to confirm that the person in the video was Ms. Henderson. Honestly, Lauren had to respect the loyalty of Ms. Henderson's community, even if it made her job more difficult.

Her editor was pressuring her to run the story before someone else did, but Lauren didn't feel great about outing someone in a persecuted minority without having at least giving her a chance to respond. Lauren glanced at the clock. Said editor would be arriving in just a few minutes. Best head over to her cubicle and figure out what she was going to say.

Not that all of this searching had been entirely useless. The lack of substantive findings had lead Lauren to develop a theory, namely that telekinetics developed their powers and went fugitive while still young. This would explain the lack of facial recognition results, as privacy laws were even stricter for minors than they were for adults. If someone dropped off the radar before their eighteenth birthday or shortly thereafter, there would be little to find.

This hunch, coupled with a fantastic reaction speed, had resulted in Lauren Gonzales being the first to press with a story on who Vera Kelly is (something that Lauren was immensely proud of). When Ms. Kelly had said her name during the Proclamation, most journalists had begun looking for a Vera Kelly who had disappeared in the past couple of decades. Lauren instead had gone back forty-plus years. And she had found it: a story in the *Boston Globe* about a disappeared college student by the name of Vera Kelly.

Lauren had even tracked down Ms. Kelly's undergrad roommate, one Delilah Kayne - *always check the student newspaper* - who was currently in hospice in Atlanta with terminal cancer. Perhaps more impressively, Lauren had manage to arrange for a meeting with Ms. Kayne. 

The woman, some sixty-four years old, looked much older due to the ravages of disease. Gaunt, pail, and frail. On oxygen and retaining only a few wisps of hair, she didn't look like she had much longer for this world. She was alert enough however that Lauren had been able to show her the video of the Proclamation and ask if this was the Vera Kelly from her childhood. Ms. Kayne had watched the entire video before replying.

"That's here. That's here alright. I'd recognize her anywhere. God damn, she aged better than I did. Girl always was a survivor."

"Is there anything you would like to say to her, if you had the chance?"

"So many things. That I miss her. That I'm glad she's a live. That I still think about her often. That I'm glad she put that scooter to good use. That I hope she puts those fuckers in the ground." Ms. Kayne had begun laughing at this point, which transitioned into uncontrollable coughing. Small flecks of blood flew from her lips. Almost immediately, a nurse entered the room - he had probably been waiting outside - and ushered Lauren outside. As they left, Lauren could have sworn she saw tears running from Ms. Kayne's eyes.

As if this wasn't enough confirmation, the government tail sealed the deal. Lauren had reported in enough dangerous situations to stay aware of her surroundings. So when undercover agents began following her away from the hospice, she noticed almost immediately. She had thought about ignoring them, but then chose the opposite tact. She had speed up her pace, turned a corner, then waited. When the agent came hustling after her, she got right up in his face with her press pass in one hand and a can of pepper spray in the other.

"My editor knows exactly where I am and if you try anything, I will scream. Now back the fuck off."

Annoyance flashed across the agents face and he took a few steps back. 

"Now, what agency do you work for?"

"I can't answer that. What did Ms. Kayne say to you?"

"You can wait and read my story like everyone else." Lauren turned and walked away.

"Ma'am, this is a matter of national security."

Lauren didn't stop, though she did give him a middle finger over her shoulder.

Her story, government tail and all, ran the next day.

***

Lauren smiled at the memory of that little interaction as she slid into her cubicle chair, thermos still in hand. Maybe she should leverage the success of the Vera Kelly stories to convince her editor to give just a little bit more space on this Matilda Henderson piece. She took another sip of coffee, then noticed something on her desk. A folded card, crease up in the air like a cheap name placard. On the side visible to her, was written in cursive handwriting, "For Lauren Gonzalez."

A chill settled over her. A threat? A prank? This building had pretty good security. Not just anyone could sneak a card like this onto her desk. Never one to back down from a challenge, she set her thermos down and picked up the card. Flipping it open, she saw more of the same neat cursive on the interior.

"If you would like an exclusive interview with telekinetics, please meet us at 8am this morning on the south corner of Lexington and 72nd. You may bring one cameraperson and one person empowered to make publishing decisions on behalf of your employer. Do not speak to anyone else about this. You may bring whatever recording equipment you can carry, but leave behind anything that could be used to track you, such as your cellphone. If you are not present on time or do not follow these instructions, you will not here from us again. Yours truly, Vera Kelly."

Lauren read the note three times, weighing the likelihood of its legitimacy and the potential consequences, positive and negative, of her choice. She looked at the clock. 5:30am. Good. She didn't exactly have time to waste but this was very doable. She stood, picking up her thermos in one hand and pulling out her cellphone with another as she started walking.

Jim. That's who would be her cameraman. Reliable in a tight spot and likely to be in the office already. She called Charles, the company lawyer she trusted the most, which wasn't saying much. 

A groggy voice picked up the phone. "Jesus, Lauren. I know you never sleep but some of us do, you know?"

"Good morning, Charles!" She answered cheerfully. The excitement of a major break in a story was creeping up on her. "I need your ass at the office no later than 7am."

"Can you at least tell me why?"

"Nope!" Her voice was positively bubbly at this point. "See you then!"

She reached her editor's office as the phone slipped back into her pocket. She cracked the door and stuck her head in. He was sipping coffee himself (out of a mug rather than a thermos) and reading over a story draft on his laptop. He looked up immediately but before he could react, she spoke.

"Gonna be gone all day following up a lead. Just wanted to give you a heads up."

Confusion spread across his face. "But what about writing up the Henderson story?"

"Trust me on this one, please?" She didn't wait for a response. In a flash the door was closed and she was striding over to Jim's office, a massive grin on her face.

***

No later than 7:45am, the three of them - journalist, videographer, a lawyer - were standing on the designated corner. Jim didn't know what the recording environment would be like, so he had tried to bring anything that might be useful, drafting his colleagues into helping to carry the bulky equipment. Lauren accepted this charge gladly but Charles, who wasn't used to carrying more than a briefcase, had to be persuaded. They had managed it though and now they had fifteen minutes to catch their breath.

Or thought they did. Less than a minute after they got dropped off, a white van pulled over on the curb next to them. Two individuals, masked with balaclavas, were sitting up front. The one in the passenger seat, a woman, called out the window.

"Get in."

Lauren wasn't so foolish as to readily obey. "How do we know you're who we're meeting with? "

The woman grabbed the bottom edge of her balaclava and pulled it up over her face and flashed Lauren a smile. It was Matilda Henderson! A moment later, the balaclava was back down. 

Lauren picked up her share of the gear. "Come on, this is the real deal!"

The following hour was a complicated process of zig-zagging across the city and occasionally switching vehicles and drivers (all masked). Eventually, they pulled up to the back entrance of a Brooklyn Hotel and were shepherded inside, upstairs (thankfully their hosts took charge of the heavy recording equipment), and into a large penthouse suite. The three of them and there equipment were deposited in a room with glass table. Sitting across from them was Vera Kelly, dressed in the same maroon suit from the Proclamation. Ms. Kelly rose to welcome them.

"It's a pleasure to meet you and your colleagues, Lauren." She extended a hand. Lauren took it and shook politely. "Before we proceed, I want to be clear that until we reach an agreement on the terms of the interviews, all of this is off the record. Is that understood?"

Lauren nodded. "Of course." It was good to know that they were dealing with someone reasonably media savvy. While it may make her job a bit more difficult, it lowered the risk of her unintentionally screwing over her sources. 

Ms. Kelly gestured at them to sit. She pulled out three copies of the same document and slid them over. As she did so, the recording equipment lifted off the ground on its own and began floating out a door that opened seemingly for them. This was the first time that Lauren had seen telekinesis in person and it was a marvel. Jim began to protest but Ms. Kelly cut him off.

"No harm will come to your equipment. My colleagues are just going to examine it to make sure that it isn't actively transmitting our location or surreptitiously recording this discussion. I hope you can understand our caution. While we are operating more openly in recent weeks, we are still being hunted. If the HDU gets wind of where we are, we will have to cut this interview short."

Lauren put a hand on Jim's arm and he assented.

Ms. Kelly smiled and gestured at the documents, one of which was already in Charles hands and being read. "In the next room are several members of the Sodality - that's what we call our organization. They have agreed to be interviewed by you. What you hold in your hands are the terms of the interview. Please read over them. I am happy to answer any questions or negotiate over anything you find problematic."

Lauren took a look at her copy, expecting the worst. Revolutionary groups often want total control over their media coverage. The problem is that makes it more propaganda than journalism. Thankfully, that's not what the telekinetics were asking for. Lauren could interview any of the provided telekinetics. She could ask them any question on any topic. Anything outside of the recorded interviews themselves was off the record. The interviews could last as long as she wanted, though if any of the three of them from the news agency left the suite, the interview was over. Lauren retained full editorial control, though she had to publish at least one video program on the interview in no less than seven days from now. The Sodality would retain a copy of the footage and after the seven days had elapsed, retained the right to provide the raw, unedited files to other news sources or to publish them themselves. 

This all seemed workable to Lauren, though Charles balked at the last requirement. 

Ms. Kelly refused to budge however. "We don't want to interfere with your editorial control, but you have to understand that we can ill afford a hit job at the moment. This is our insurance against your superiors or the U.S. government or anyone else pressuring you into releasing a misleading edit."

"Are you serious about the any topic part?" Lauren was surprised that a secretive group like this would be so open. "For instance, I could ask about where your organization, the Sodality, is based out of? I can ask about where you will strike next? About how you are funded?"

Ms. Kelly smiled, looking for a brief moment simultaneously like a kindly grandmother and a cutthroat politician. "Yes, though we do not promise to answer every question with the level of detail you might like or at all. You are welcome to record and publish our refusals to answer however."

Lauren nodded, her mind racing constructing a game plan. "What about you?"

Ms. Kelly tilted her head slightly. "About me?"

"You said there are telekinetics in the next room that I can interview. But can I interview you."

This seemed to embarrass Ms. Kelly slightly. "We would need to place some limits on topics, I'm afraid. I am happy to talk about the Sodality, our mission, our goals, but I do not intend to answer questions about myself or my past."

"Pardon me, Ms. Kelly --"

"You can call me Vera."

"Pardon me, Vera, but right now *you* are the face of telekinetics. You are the name everyone is talking about. The people want to know who you are. Do you not want to take this chance to tell your story?"

"It wasn't a desire for the limelight that kept me alive this long, I'm afraid. The answer is no."

*Dammit.* Lauren cursed to herself. *Don't get me wrong, being the first journalist in the world to interview telekinetics is a helluva get, but I would have loved to get Vera as part of the deal.* She decided to make one last attempt.

"Is there anything you would like to say to Delilah Kayne, if you had the chance?"

Vera's eyebrow arched in a minor rebuke. "Child, I have already told her all that I had to say in person."[^33]

[^33]:I wish there was more to say on this point. Xinyue did later confirm that Vera went to visit Delilah in hospice two days following Lauren Gonzalez's visit. She had gone to this visit alone however, a surprisingly reckless act considering the scrutiny that Delilah was under at the time. How she snuck in without being noticed by the HDU or anyone else, I do not know. I also do not know what the two spoke of during that visit, as Vera never spoke of it and Delilah passed from this mortal coil only a few days later. 

***

The rest of the negotiations went smoothly enough. Charles quibbled over some language and added some more detail here and there. For instance, he successfully negotiated up to a ten day embargo and for the clock to start at the conclusion of the interviews rather than the beginning. Vera had everyone sign the final language, more of a symbol than a legally binding contract. No one seriously expected the Sodality to file a lawsuit and show up in court. Not for some time yet.

Over the course of that day and the next (the three were provided beds in the suite to sleep in overnight), Lauren interviewed Vera (purely on the Sodality), Xinyue, Arsène, Akin, Tillie, Andrea, and Antonio, some of them multiple times. As interested as she was in the mechanics of telekinesis and the politics of the Sodality, she also made a clear effort to provide a space for each person to tell the story of who they were as an individual. She even garnered enough material about Vera from interviewing the others that she was able to write up a piece titled, "Vera Kelly's Silhouette." 

The publication of Lauren's pieces, both the televised interviews and the written articles, marked a charge in the Sodality's tactics. While public demonstrations and leaking documents continued, they took a back seat to dual track effort. One track was led by Vera and Xinyue, who began formal outreach and negotiation with governments around the world, as well as additional interviews and written calls-to-action. The other track, led by Ezekiel and Arsène, consisted by attacks on HDU and HDU-like facilities around the world. 

Over the coming weeks and months, nations staked out their position on the "telekinetic issue." Some, such as the Netherlands, took prompt action to dismantle their telekinetic oppression agency and even arrested many of those involved. They began passing laws guaranteeing rights and due process for telekinetics. Unfortunately such nations were few and far between. Most either tried to remain neutral or actively rejected the Sodality's overtures. 

As weeks turned into months and months turned into seasons, a faction of the Sodality led by Ezekiel, Flora, and Antonio became increasingly impatient. They pointed out that, while the United Nations General Assembly had voted to establish a committee to negotiate with the telekinetics, only two of the major world powers (the European Union and India) had agreed to participate. The United States, riven by massive protests both for and against telekinetics, refused to come to the table until the Sodality unilaterally agreed to stop their attacks on the HDU and the Netherlands repatriated Director Harris.[^34] China and Russia both insisted that governance of telekinetics within their borders was a matter of domestic policy. Many smaller nations nominally said that they supported telekinetic rights, while slow-walking any meaningful changes and continuing to allow the telekinetic oppression organizations to operate within their borders.

[^34]:To their immense credit, the Dutch government refused to do so.

Amid all of this, the Sodality was missing novitiate awakenings. The organization had never achieved truly global coverage (South and East Asia, South Africa, and Oceania in particular) and now, spread thin with the ongoing war, even some previously well covered areas suffered losses. This more impatient faction argued that the nations of the world were not taking the Sodality seriously and wouldn't do so until the telekinetics forced their hand. They argued for the elimination of the Sodality's no-kill policy and, in those nations that were openly opposed to the Sodality, an expansion of the theater of operations to include the conventional military.[^35]

[^35]:Note that this faction was specifically arguing for destroying military materiel such as tanks, planes, and ships. They did not argue for the mass slaughter of soldiers or for targeting nuclear weapons. They may have been more willing to use violence, but they weren't insane.

This faction was a relatively small portion of the Sodality, however. Vera, Xinyue, Arsène, and many others successfully argued for patience, pointing out that international diplomacy is not measured in weeks or months but in years. The more radical faction was still committed to telekinetic unity and so agreed to abide by the collective decision, though they did not stop their persuasion efforts.

And so things progressed for the following year.

## Intermission - A Murder

*One year after the Proclamation*

Sometimes history is shaped by great forces of culture and economics, massive social movements and revolutions in thought. Sometimes history is shaped by a particular individual who takes advantage of the right circumstances, or who proactively shapes those circumstances, to transform the world. And sometimes history is shaped by a series of small accidents: a phone call is cut short by a dropped signal, a particular February day is unusually warm, a horse stumbles over a cracked shoe, a child falls ill.

April 7th, 2056, a momentous day in history, was of the last type.

***

Karol idly swiped his phone screen, skimming a thread of comments and images as the local Łosice news played on the living room television. He was lounging on his parents' faded green couch, trying to motivate himself to apply for more software jobs. But each time he tried to think seriously about his situation or his future, a wave of disgust and self-loathing swept through him, only to be transmogrified into anger and bitterness. Here he was, hiding in his hometown to avoid telling his friends that he had been fired by a black woman. It didn't make any difference that she was American, a representative of his (now former) employer's parent company, rather than one of the invaders from across the Mediterranean. Thinking about her, picturing her face in that final meeting, made him want to throw his phone across the room. 

*How dare she lie through her teeth and tell him that the company was trying to "right-size" in the current "rough economy" and they all had to make "difficult decisions!" Difficult decisions, my ass!* She was glad to be rid of him. He knew the real reason she had fired him. It's because he hadn't made any secret of his politics, that he was a proud Pole who wanted to defend his homeland from invaders, be it the dark-skinned ones who had been flooding in for half a century now or the new witches that now stalked unseen among the righteous.

And so here he was at his parents', hiding from his Warsaw friends. Just until he could figure something out. Find some other job. Tell people that he quit of his own volition. Karol cursed under his breath and got up to grab a drink from the kitchen fridge. He didn't care that it was only 11am. Only a few steps from the couch, a breaking news broadcast on the television caught his attention.

The witches had attacked a Polish army installation! And the army had lost! *This country really is going to hell, isn't it? Somebody needs to do something before the cowards in the Sejm drive us all off a cliff.* Karol moved to spit in disgust, then recalled that this was his mother's house. He swallowed his spittle. 

Then he saw the image of the man. It took him a moment to process what he was looking at. The face of a witch. How? Apparently the military base was on the list of targets that the witches had publicized. Some enterprising journalist had hidden cameras around the outskirts of the campus, hoping to catch something. And it had paid off. One of those cameras had caught the arrival of the witches, lowering out of the sky. Karol shuddered upon witnessing their unnaturalness. Most were masked or facing away from the camera, towards the base. But one had glanced over his shoulder at something just off camera. The news broadcast had paused the video there and zoomed in on the face as they discussed casualty counts and vehement but empty statements from politicians. Something about that face resonated with Karol, driving the thought of drink from his mind. That face felt familiar. Before Karol could identify the nature of the familiarity, however, the broadcast moved on to footage of the base just minutes later, leveled by the witches.[^23]

[^23]:This was the only television broadcast of the surreptitious video in Poland. The journalist who placed the cameras was affiliated with the local Łosice news, so the segment that Karol watched was its first airing. Within an hour, however, the Polish security service had impounded the video and prohibited it from being shared further. It was soon scrubbed from the broadcaster's website, though copies continued to be shared across the internet afterwards. 

Hurriedly, Karol turned to his phone, still in his hand, and searched for the video. He found it on the broadcasters website. He held the small screen close, waiting for the moment. When the man turned to look over his shoulder, Karol paused the video. *Who was he?* The jawline. The mouth that held a trace of a grin - *no, of malicious glee*. The heavy eyebrows. Karol squinted studying the figure. He let the video progress a few seconds further. The man turned and walked away from the camera. Then Karol's attention gradually narrowed in on the man's wide shoulders. How they were set. How they moved. They showed a firm confidence. Not an iota of fear or hesitation as to what was about to happen. Those shoulders looked like they could bear the world. Karol had seen those shoulders doing precisely that, lifting heavy loads effortlessly. *But where?*

Karol watched the man walk away. He rewound the video the paused on the the face again, starting at the frozen face for a long time, unable to draw out the memory more fully. Finally, exasperated, Karol shoved the phone in his pocket and went to get that drink. It was on his return, can in hand, that his eyes fell upon the old, beautifully varnished armoire in the corner of the living room. The one he had purchased for his mother's birthday a few years ago. The one from the antique shop in Warsaw. The one that he had seen those broad shoulders carrying.

The phone was back in his hand in a flash, the drink absentmindedly deposited on the coffee table. Karol took a screenshot of the man's face, then pulled up a thread where genuine patriots like him discussed the news and the sorry state of the country. He posted the video, adding a caption, "I know this witch. He used to work at an antique shop that I visited a while back. Maybe he still does. An American who barely knew any Polish." He hit send. Then, after a moment, he added the address of the store. 

For the next hour, Karol lay on the couch, drinking and reading responses to his post. It garnered a handful of supportive reactions and replies, but for the most part his discovery, he revelation was dismissed. Some were incredulous that a witch would work as an assistant in some antique store. *But of course they are hiding in plain sight!* Others were unwilling to believe that this witch was American rather than an Arab or an African or a Jew. Karol attempted to defend himself for a while, but eventually grew frustrated and disheartened. He threw his phone across the room and watched it tumble across the carpeted floor. He stared up the ceiling and breathed out angrily. *No one recognizes my talents.*

***

As far as can be determined, fewer than a hundred people saw Karol's post that day. One of the few who did was Jędrzej, a young Warsaw skinhead. He was catching up on the day's posts while walking from work to a local watering hole, when up scrolled Karol's post from a few hours prior.

It was the address that caught his attention, only a few blocks away. Jędrzej was a newcomer to his crew, barely nineteen years old. His new friends, his brothers, called him "the kid," something that aggravated to him to now end but also made feel like part of the family. He was itching to prove himself, to earn the respect of these men who seemed like the only real men he knew. 

He was disappointed when, after presenting his find to the crew chief, Stanimir, (interrupting Stanimir's poker game to do so), he was met with a slap to the back of his head.

"You come in here and bother me with this bullshit?" Stanimir bellowed at him. That voice struck Jędrzej like another slap. "The fuck would a witch be doing working in an antique shop? You think they're using their demonic powers to get good deals on your grandmother's silverware? Fuck off!"

A few unlucky hands later though, Stanimir noticed that Jędrzej was sulking by himself at the end of the bar. The kid looked pathetic over there, nursing that drink. The older skinhead sighed. He had a soft spot for Jędrzej, having been the one to recruit him when he was just a lost kid looking for a purpose and some proper role models.

"Fuck it. Hey kid! Get over here!" Stanimir called across the room. Jędrzej visibly flinched, then stood resolutely and walked over, like he was marching to his own execution. Kid has gumption at least. "Now look," Stanimir continued, his gruff voice taking on a more tender tone, "I still think this is bullshit, but can't hurt to check it out. You grab a few of the boys and go over there. See what you can find out."

The look of radiant joy on Jędrzej's face was reward enough. *The kid is a fucking puppy,* Stanimir thought. He shook his head and turned back to the card game. "Well? Deal the cards!"

***

It took some time for the redeemed Jędrzej to coax a handful of other skinheads away from their drinks and conversation and games. He was only successful at all because he framed the mission as "orders from Stanimir," choosing to omit their leader's skepticism. Even so, it was dark when the half-drunk group set forth on the damp streets of Warsaw.

They reached the target swiftly enough, all of them (except for Jędrzej) eager to get this fools errand over with so they could get back to warmth and booze. The antique shop lay on a well kept street of modest artist studios and workshops, most of which had apartments perched above them. The stores and studios had all recently closed for the night and the street was gradually emptying out as pedestrians sought refuge from the chill spring drizzle. The gang's destination was no exception. While the glass door was locked and had a "closed" sign clearly hanging, the windows of the second floor apartment were lit. Jędrzej hesitated, not sure how to proceed when faced with even this mild obstacle. *Does the owner live up there? Or the witch? Maybe the owner is a witch.* Feeling the eyes of the older skinheads boring into his back, Jędrzej was forced to do something. He began banging on the locked door and shouting up at the lit windows. 

"Hey! Open up!" Jędrzej didn't really expect a response. Who would open the door to a bunch of skinheads at night? Nonetheless, the sensation of his credibility rapidly draining way made him feel obligated to make a vigorous attempt. He continued banging and shouting, hitting the door hard enough he was somewhat surprised it didn't shatter. Cold droplets continued falling onto bald heads and black jackets. He was just about to stop when he heard a door open and close, accompanied by a faint voice shouting something back at him. Jędrzej paused and listened. *Yeah, someone is coming down.* He glanced over his shoulder at his comrades and grinned.

"You ready?" he asked. Several sets of unamused eyes started back at him in the dim twilight. This did nothing to dampen his enthusiasm. Then the door was unbolting and Jędrzej spun back around. The door swung upon and he was face to face with an elderly woman half his height, gray and delicate, but unbent by age. She was squinting up at him, muttering something about the impatience of the youth. Then she made a visible effort to recall her decorum. 

"Is something wrong? We're closed for the night, can't you see?" Annoyance slipped back into her voice before she finished two sentences.

"Pardon me, grandmother," Jędrzej responded politely. "We're looking for someone and we were told we could find him here."

She looked up at him, confused, uncomprehending. "Him? Here? You sure?"

Jędrzej suddenly felt foolish under this old woman's skeptical eye. He clumsily pulled out his phone, almost dropping it on the stone steps in the process. 

"Hurry it up," called one of the black-clad thugs behind him. The tone was of bored impatience. Jędrzej frantically flipped through his saved images, internally castigating himself for not having the still prepped and ready. He was beginning to wilt under the combined gazes of his friends and this shopkeep when he found it. 

"Do you know this man?" Jędrzej held up the screen before her.

She looked at the screen quizzically, then reached out to take the phone in her frail hand, her tissue paper skin brushing against Jędrzej's much larger fingers. Jędrzej let the device go. The woman brought the phone close to her face, then made a small noise of frustration. With her free hand she patted around her neck until she found the pair of reading glasses hanging by a string. She placed the glasses upon her nose and blinked a few times before making another attempt with the phone. The annoyance disappeared from her face and she let out a exclamation of pleasant recognition.

"Oh! Ezekiel! You know my boy, Ezekiel?" Only then did she take another look at the group on her front steps, able to see them more clearly now through her glasses. Shaved heads. Gothic tattoos. Angry faces. Concern flared and coursed through her entire body and she took a half step back.

Jędrzej meanwhile was suddenly full of a heady cocktail of surprise, glee, vindication, and malice. He had been right. The exact relationship between the old hag and the witch wasn't clear - mother, aunt, recruiter - that didn't matter. What mattered is that Jędrzej had found a witches' den. Maybe she was witch herself. And that name. Ezekiel. That sounded like a Jew name to him. A Jewish witch! Stanimir would proud of him tonight.

Before she could retreat farther and close the door, Jędrzej grabbed the front of her blouse and threw her down the steps onto the sidewalk, his friends jumping back out of the way, almost knocking each other over. He leapt down after her, a black blur in the night, and began furiously kicking her while shouting epithets. The others swiftly joined in, shouldering each other aside to get their chance in to land a few strikes.

Carla made hardly any sound after an initial gasp of surprise. She curled into a ball on the cold, wet sidewalk, vainly trying to protect herself from the blows raining down upon her. In a matter of moments, she was no longer moving at all.

Jędrzej stepped back from the prone body, leaving his friends to continue the violence. He was breathing heavily from a combination of adrenaline and exertion. He used his sleeve to swipe a mix of rain and sweat from his face as he spun in a circle, mirroring the motion in his mind. He looked up and saw the storefront. The lights were still on upstairs. The job wasn't done yet.

"Come on! We have a witch to find. Burn 'em to ash! Suffer not a witch to live!" He bounded up the steps and into the house. The group of fellow murders tromped up the stairs behind him and into the store, their black boots leaving smears of red behind. The rain intensified into a downpour, washing the blood down the sidewalk.

Not far away, a train had just pulled into station. A man was stepping off the train and onto the rain-slicked streets of Warsaw. A tall man with heavy eyebrows and broad shoulders that looked like they could carry the world.

***

This was not the first such lynching. Nor would it be the last. During the weeks, months, and years following the Proclamation, the world bore witness to a wide variety of reactions. The public discovery of telekinesis was met with disbelief, exultation, despair, and much else. One of the most predictable and most tragic was the mix of religious and political movements founded on the fear and hatred of telekinetics. Demons, aliens, the Illuminati. The members of the Sodality were called these and much worse. 

Such groups varied in their size, organization, and vehemence, from the spontaneous outburst of a panicked mob to the deliberate action of a theocratic autocracy. All were dangerous in their own way, more to friends and family of the Sodality than to telekinetics themselves, who were all too capable of defending themselves with even a modicum of training. Most often, however, it was innocents were made the targets of ire. A young boy who can skip rocks a little too precociously attracts the attention of a local priest. A political opposition leader becomes a little too troublesome to the authorities. A roulette player gets a little too lucky for a casino's comfort. Any of these (and much less) could lead to accusations and attacks. 

Vera Kelly had known this would occur but could do little to prevent it in the short term, particularly the smaller, isolated incidents. This was one of the reasons she had been so reluctant to reveal the existence of telekinetics and one of the reasons why she was working so furiously to forge a better world. All of the members of the Sodality knew this, had discussed it at length, and had taken action where necessary. Family members were relocated. Identities were concealed. Authorities were enlisted in those places willing to cooperate with the Sodality or just to protect their own citizenry. All were aware that such measures were fallible however. All prepared themselves to suffer losses. Or told themselves they had.

This was not the first such lynching. And for all the tragedy of even one such murder, it may have past unremarked by the world like so many other had in the past and would in the future. But this one would not be so easily forgotten.

***

A thousand little things could have happened differently. If one of the telekinetics present at that Polish operation had noticed the camera, they might have destroyed or obscured it. If that particular telekinetic had not happened to look over his shoulder, his face may not have been captured. If the camera had caught the face of a different member of the Sodality, it may have only captured one whose identity was already known or at least one more prone to restraint. If that middle-aged man had not been laid off earlier that week, he may have missed that news broadcast. If he had failed to recognize the telekinetic, the broadcast may had little consequence. If he was not politically aligned with the nationalist right, he may not have posted his discovery where he did. If his post had gone unnoticed, there would have been no crew of angry men. If the elderly antique dealer hadn't been home that evening, the hate-filled bravados may have vented their spite on any empty building or just have gone home empty-handed. And if she had recognized the motives of her questioners, she may have dissembled.

If Ezekiel had not, even as the woman he called mother was breathing her last and her home was going up in flames, been stepping off the train at Warsaw Central Station, he may have only learned of her murder later, at greater physical and emotional distance, instead of coming across her still warm, broken body laying on the streets. If he had arrived minutes earlier, he may have saved her life or at least found the perpetrators still present and able to be punished, rather than just an empty street, hateful graffiti, and the howl of approaching sirens.

If any of these conditionals had instead been an actuality. Warsaw would still be standing. But they were not and so it is not.


## Chapter 15 - A Massacre

*One year after the Proclamation*

Vera tore through the air, heading straight towards the unmistakable signal. She was making no attempt at concealment. A dark blur flashing across the sky at supersonic speeds, leaving behind a sonic boom that rattled buildings and started multitudes. Vera, carrying a capsule of still air with her, outpaced sound itself and flew in near silence. To her physical ears, anyways. A relay of telekinetics that spanned the globe was conveying messages back and forth. Only a couple of hours ago, they had all, even those half a world away, been awakened by the signal, no, the violent scream in the tangled weave that they could hear with their extrasensory perception. Vera and Ameera had been in a meeting in New York City on the 22nd floor of the United Nations headquarters, negotiating terms with diplomats and arguing over word choice. It had taken five seconds for Vera to process what she was sensing and decide on an initial course of action. She had departed through the conference room window. Ameera temporarily remained behind to ensure none of the diplomats were hurt by the shattered glass and to ensure no documents were lost in the sudden intrusion of high winds into the interior of the building.

Now, she was somewhere over eastern Germany, already slowing to avoid overshooting her target. Reports and inquiries were all being fed to Vera by members of the Sodality. To the reports, Vera responded with curt, urgent orders or demands for updates. To the inquiries she didn't respond at all. Vera's attention was turned ahead of her, towards what was happening in Warsaw.

The general picture was as clear as it was horrific: Ezekiel was leveling the city, killing all but a precious few who were able to flee before him. What wasn't at all clear was why. A few days ago, Ezekiel ran an attack on the PDP, the Eastern European equivalent of HDU. The report she had received stated that it was a success, the facility destroyed, commanders captured, and few casualties. As far as she knew, as far as anyone in the Sodality knew, he was supposed to be taking a short break. 

Ultimately, however, the reason for this massacre did not matter. What mattered is what she and the Sodality were going to do about it. Which was stop Ezekiel. There had been two attempts already. One was by Arsène, who was even now racing to Poland from southeast Asia, using the telekinetic signals developed by the Sodality to alternately beg, order, and threaten Ezekiel into standing down. There had been no response yet, though if Vera could hear Arsène from here, so too could Ezekiel. Assuming he was listening.

The second was more direct. A half dozen telekinetics, led by Xinyue and Akin, had swiftly arrived on the scene and attempted to forcibly stop the destruction. The ensuing struggle made it clear that even all six of them together were no match for Ezekiel. Once both of Akin's legs were violently broken, all six had fallen back. After regrouping, they had considered launching another attack, but Vera had ordered them to instead focus on evacuating as many people as possible from Ezekiel's path. She would deal with the wayward son herself.

***

If the rising telekinetic scream of Ezekiel's violence had not been enough, Vera could have told she was nearing her destination by the vehicles beneath her. Every road heading away from Warsaw was packed with automobiles full of people desperate to get as far as they could from the human maelstrom behind them. Streaming in the other direction, often on the shoulders of packed roads, were Polish military convoys: tanks, artillery, and personnel transports full of infantry. *Were they terrified too?* Vera wondered. *Did they even know what they were heading towards?* She doubted that there was much in the way of munitions that could stop an alert Ezekiel short of a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. Vera desperately hoped that no nation was launching exactly that.

Then she noticed the downed aircraft littering the farms and towns near Warsaw. Despite his silence in the face of Arsène's entreaties, Ezekiel must certainly be paying acute attention to his surroundings if he noticed and destroyed these planes so far out. Vera could distinguish aircraft belonging to the PDP from those belonging to the more conventional Polish Air Force by their manner of destruction. The latter had wings, engines, or cockpits straightforwardly crushed by Ezekiel's will. The former, bearing suppressors that prevented Ezekiel's direct action against them, were instead pierced through with hurled steel and concrete, long before they could reach their target. Vera felt a trill of fear in her chest. If Ezekiel was capable of exerting such force at this distance, he was stronger than even she knew.

Ezekiel had certainly noticed her. She wasn't trying to hide or take him by surprise. She doubted that she could have if she had wanted to. So she flew openly, the vibrations of her flight echoing forth, her awareness blanketing the city to survey the damage, occasionally intersecting with that of Ezekiel, though he showed no reaction and did not change his course in the slightest.

Now Vera could see the maelstrom across the city with her own eyes. Not a single skyscraper remained standing in the core of the city. There were only swirling clouds, dust, and debris. She could feel precisely where Ezekiel was, what he was doing, but could not see him. A living tornado. Worse even. She had often wondered what telekinetics like her were capable of, at their limits. So had all the members of the Sodality. For most of them, Ezekiel perhaps moreso than any other, those musings had been tinged with desire and fantasy. For Vera they had also been tinged with dread. Now she could see that dread made manifest. She wished it had stayed a theoretical exercise.

As her awareness swept over the ruinscape before her, she saw, no felt, the countless broken bodies in the streets, in crumpled cars, and under collapsed buildings. This view in her mind's eye was far more horrific than any mundane glance or photograph could capture, as she saw in and under and around the debris that had once constituted a city, could see each individual, including those not quite dead yet. She recognized something else too that cut her to the bone: Ezekiel could see all of this. Destruction at this scale was usually impersonal, the product of either natural disasters or human warfare at a distance: bombs, artillery, missiles. The soldiers who launched those weapons were often many miles away and unable to witness the consequences of their actions. Those who gave the orders were often farther still, maybe halfway around the world. For them, an attack was a theoretical exercise, moving pieces on a chessboard. 

Ezekiel could see, he *must* see his handiwork far more keenly than any rifleman or bomber pilot or general possibly could. Each person he had killed was not a distant smudge, a colored blur, tiny speck, a cold statistic. He had seen each and every face. He could feel each and every one struggle to breath their last. And he had killed them anyways. In a very real sense his own bare hands were wrapped around each of his victims' necks.  She couldn't fathom such cruelty.

***

Before approaching closer, Vera identified the military's western staging point along the A2 highway on the outskirts of the city. *I can't have them getting themselves killed or getting in my way,* she thought to herself as she changed her trajectory. She swooped down towards the leading edge of the gathered vehicles and soldiers. Shouts of alarm rang out at her approach and rifles were trained in her direction. Vera prepared herself to deflect bullets, but no order to open fire was given and the Polish soldiers maintained their trigger discipline. Her feet touched down on the asphalt as her eyes swept the line of soldiers. She kept her arms at her side, her hands open, palms facing the crowd, in what she hoped this would be taken as a gesture of peace. Not that her hands had anything to do with her potential lethality. 

"I need to speak to your commanding officer!" Vera called. 

An officer pushed through the infantry line to stand before Vera. A middle-aged woman of middling height, her black hair pulled back in a tight bun. To her credit, there was no fear in her eyes, only defiance. Her tilted jaw, her steely gaze, the set of her shoulders, all conveyed one message, "After all your words of peace, you have brought war. So be it then, we shall fight." But when she opened her mouth, she said only, "I am Polkovnik Piatek," in accented English.

*Is that a name or a rank? Both?* Vera thought. She didn't have the time or inclination to figure it out. This woman seemed to be an authority figure, which is what Vera needed.

"I am going to stop him." Vera pointed at Warsaw behind her in case it wasn't clear who she was talking about. "The one destroying Warsaw. I need you to keep your troops here while I do so."

Polkovnik Piatek's face betrayed nothing. Not a denial but no acceptance either. For a moment Vera wasn't sure if the officer had understood her. Vera desperately wished that she spoke Polish at this moment. But then a response came.

"He must face Polish justice. You cannot take him." 

Vera considered this carefully but swiftly. Every moment she delayed here, more people died at Ezekiel's hand in the city. Could she really turn over one of her own to the Polish government, who had steadfastly refused to take action to protect telekinetics? But Ezekiel wasn't hers anymore. Not after this. 

"He will leave here in your hands, Polkovnik Piatek."

The officer studied Vera for a moment. Then barked a short order in Polish over her shoulder. A soldier came running up with a radio. Piatek snatched the radio out of his hands and began speaking rapidly but clearly into it. Vera stood waiting, assuming that the officer was seeking guidance from her superiors. But then to her surprise, Piatek, paused her speech and lowered the radio from her face. She looked at Vera with angry exasperation.

"Well? What are you still doing here? Go!"

Vera didn't hesitate. She spun and lifted into the air, moving rapidly towards the northeastern sector of the city, where Ezekiel was continuing his warpath. It was time to enter the maelstrom.

*He will leave here in your hands, Polkovnik Piatek. If he leaves here at all.*

***

Vera alighted on an bare stretch of concrete amidst the rubble. What had once been a bustling plaza was now a rare flat piece of land in the crumpled ruins of the city.

"Ezekiel, you must cease this wantonness." She spoke calmly, at a low volume. Even the loudest shout would have been ripped away in that howling gale. But she projected those world along silvery threads through the opaque whirlwind before her to its core.

There was no response to her words. The whirlwind continued in its course.

"You would kill countless who cannot possibly touch you, but you are too cowardly to speak to the one who saved you? Or is all this senseless violence, done for no reason than to make a small man feel powerful?" Vera's usual tact and humility were gone. Ezekiel had always been proud, but this act spoke of such cruel arrogance that Vera felt compelled to puncture his ego.

And it worked. The whirlwind stopped in its course, though its intensity diminished not one iota. Vera could feel the weight of Ezekiel's awareness bear down on her. *He's trying to intimidate me.* Vera realized. *Me!* The thought almost pulled a bitter laugh from her.

"They killed her." The voice that escaped those winds was flat, dead. Not a shout. More hopeless than angry.

Vera raced to parse those pronouns. Was "they" any group in particular? Who was "her"? The members of the Sodality were accounted for. What family Ezekiel had were thousands of miles away. Who did he know here in Warsa -- The answer to her in a flash, a series of intuitive connections that sketched out the general picture. So that was the reason for this. No, not the reason. There could be no reason for this. That woman's death was perhaps an explanation for this mass violence, but it wasn't a justification.

"They killed her. And so now you kill their city." Vera's tone was flat now too, almost matching Ezekiel's.

"And so now I kill their city." He repeated her. 

A long silence stretched before them, filled only with the howling wind still driven by the whip of Ezekiel's will.

"I will not discuss this with you," Vera said. "The time for words is over. Cease this. Now." 

"And turn myself over to those beasts? I heard the promise you made to that animal in a colonel's uniform."

"Yes. They are no more beasts you or I. Need I reminder you that the woman you mourn was Polish? That she was a resident of this c--"

"You are right, Vera." Ezekiel interrupted. His tone was bitter now, with an almost mocking edge. "The time for words is indeed over."

And then he struck.

It was a massive blow, a circle some 20 meters in diameter, centered on Vera, was instantly compressed 3 meters into the ground with a deafening crash. Ezekiel had not tried to conceal his attack, however, so Vera had just enough time to throw up a defense, instinctively shielding her head with her arms and throwing all of her effort into blocking the blow. She remained standing, on narrow cylinder of concrete and stone just wide enough for her feet. It had been a close thing. Ezekiel, even after destroying a city, far outmatched her in terms of raw strength. She doubted she could block even one or two more such blows. Her eyes widened in shock. That was no warning shot, no sparring match. It was not even a blow meant to disable, such as he had delivered to Akin. *He struck to kill me. What madness is this?*

After only a moment's pause, Ezekiel struck again, just as directly, just as brutally. But what he lacked in subtlety, Vera had in abundance. And now her surprise had passed. She could not accept another such blow, so she would not. As Ezekiel struck out, Vera reached out and delicately shifted the strike, deflecting it to her right. It pummeled the ground again, deepening that portion of the crater yet further. Another strike and it went wide again, to the left. A third was dispersed, falling all around its intended target, but leaving her infuriatingly unscathed.

For strike after strike, Vera distorted and altered and frustrated what should have been an endless series of lethal blows. As blinded by rage as Ezekiel was, he was no dullard. He quickly began mixing up his strikes, compensating for the flaws and vulnerabilities that Vera had just demonstrated. But each time, her will was there before he was, with some novel stratagem. No longer was she ducking under raised up arms. She stood tall, her hands clasped behind her back, staring directly at Ezekiel through the cloud of debris. This was Vera in her element. Yes, she was leader and mother to the Sodality. Yes, she was the diplomat and stateswoman trying to forge a system of rights and regulations on the international stage. But these roles were fundamentally just that. Roles. Responsibilities. Distractions. This, this right here, exercising her power fluidly, creatively, constantly on the precipice of joining the innumerable corpses of this city, this was *who she was*. She had no time to think about planning and stratagems and diplomacy. There was only the coming blow and the one after that. For all her compassion and care, Vera was taking a bit of viscous pleasure in humbling this fool. Who was he to think his natural strength gave him authority over those without such power? To take lives as though they meant nothing? Who was he to betray her, who had rescued him and taught him so much? Who was he to think that he *could* best her? He had been taught to use his power in safety and security. She had been force to learn in desperation and necessity, knowing that she would die if she didn't learn fast enough. So this situation, for all its unprecedented  aspects, was no novelty to her. She didn't just *use* her power, she *was* her power and now, for once in her life, she could show everyone what that meant.

If any bystanders within half a mile or more remained alive under the ruins of buildings, their lives came to a swift end, their bodies crushed in the collateral damage.

Vera offered no counterattack, no response that Ezekiel could see. She continued to act entirely defensively, protecting herself but nothing more, demonstrating the futility of the attacks. She didn't want to merely best her opponent. She wanted to show him that he should never *so much as think* about defying her in this way. Ezekiel, for all his immense strength that no six members of the Sodality together could match, began, ever so slightly to flag. He had destroyed a city and all of its inhabitants in the most brutal way possible. And now he was spending immense effort trying to crush his one time savior. Vera's ingenuity, meanwhile, seemed endless. 

This battle was over. Whatever minute chance Ezekiel had was spent the moment his first blow failed. Now, his endurance fading, he had to realize this. The demonstration had been made. There was no point in prolonging this further. A weariness swept over Vera as her more conscious mind took back over and she began to consider all that would follow this battle. She spoke again into Ezekiel's ear. "Surely you see how this ends? Please. Cease." Her plea was met only with a wordless rage and a renewed intensity of blows.

Vera sighed and closed her eyes. A moment's pause. Then her eyes snapped open and her mind leapt forward. It was a simple gesture, a flash of Vera's will that was faster than Ezekiel could follow. The final tightening of a knot already tied. A signature on a completed painting. For just a moment he perceived it, the incomprehensible pattern that Vera had been weaving with every deflection, every dispersal. The impenetrable fence that she had erected without him even noticing. In that moment he realized that he hadn't been defeated. He had never stood a chance.

And then, just as suddenly, he was falling. The howling winds ceased and the airborne debris tumbled out of the sky, silence rushing in to fill the sudden void. His powers had ceased as completely as if he stood pressed up against an operational HDU suppressor machine. The entire Sodality sensed it, no matter where they were in the world. Ezekiel and all his energy had simply vanished from the world.

Vera's eyes traced the fall of his tumbling, flailing body. A silhouette in the evening sun, only just now appearing from the storm clouds he had gathered. If he shouted or cried out as he fell, she did not hear him. She made no move to arrest his fall. Not with her body or her mind. She simply watched as he struck what had once been the side of a building, but was now just a angled piece of concrete. His body half rolled, half slid, out of sight, leaving a trail of blood.

She stood still there, on her pinnacle of stone, for what seemed like an eternity. Then, slowly, she lifted up and drifted towards Ezekiel. He was dead. Mangled beyond recognition. There would be no dramatic last words. No plea for forgiveness or final expression of defiance. One of her very first students was dead, by her hand. Vera knelt over his body. If she said anything, if she shed any tears or uttered any imprecations, no one saw or heard. Ameera, who had just arrived, watched from her airborne vantage, but was too shocked by what she had just witnessed to reach out her awareness and observe more closely. Military helicopters, previously circling at a standoff distance established by Xinyue and the others, were now approaching, but the telescoping lenses on their cameras captured only Vera's hunched back, obscuring the corpse before her.

Vera lifted the body, not with her mind alone but with her own two hands. She rose off the ground and slowly floated back to the military checkpoint. 

The same officer was there, waiting. Journalists had arrived and assembled just beyond the hastily erected barricade, filming her arrival. She gently touched down, walked a few final steps towards the officer and set down the body, if the broken mess that could be called a body. 

"I promised to deliver him to you, Polkovnik Piatek." Vera voice was as calm as ever but something strange glinted in her eye. Sorrow? Rage? Regret? "Here he is. Do what you will with him." 

Before the officer could say anything, Vera turned and strode towards the barricade. The soldiers eyed her warily but did not move. The more timid of the journalists, standing just behind them, backed away. Perhaps they thought the distance of a few feet would have made any difference if Vera desired to harm them. She had no such desire however. Or at least, she gave no indication if she did. Then again, perhaps they were just appalled by her appearance, covered as she was in Ezekiel's blood.

She stopped just shy of the barrier and addressed the assembled cameras and the countless watchers looking out through those black lenses.

"A tragedy occurred here today. No. 'Tragedy' does not encompass what has occurred here today. I don't know if any word does. Maybe 'death.' The death of the innocent. The death of the guilty. Just death. None of this should have occurred today. None of this should have occurred ever. It happened because we chose it. Each of you. And me. And the dead, him in particular." She looked over her shoulder at what had once been Ezekiel.

She paused and took a deep breath, steadying herself before continuing. Her left hand clenched and relaxed several times. Her face turned back to the journalists. "It will happen again. It will happen again and again if we do not choose otherwise. It will not spare you because you think you are innocent. It will not spare you if you *are* innocent. It did not spare the children of this city. It will not spare your children. It will not spare your armies. It will not spare my people. It will not spare me. This is not a threat. It is a sorrowful prediction. Look at what happened here today. Consider what will happen tomorrow. Choose otherwise."

With those words, Vera stopped speaking. After a moment, she opened her mouth as though to continue, but then closed it again. She seemed to be wrestling with something, trying to put some unspeakable truth into words. The journalists, so prone to shouting questions when given half a chance, abided silently, waiting eagerly for some additional syllables, some revelation that would explain this tragedy and put the world back in order. 

As if she knew what her audience craved, Vera shook her head. "No. Too many words already. Come, let us all look for survivors."

With that said, Vera lifted into the sky and flew back towards what had once been Warsaw, red droplets falling from her hands and clothes as she went. As the journalists watched, several other human silhouettes appeared in the late afternoon sky, all headed towards the city. After a moment, the colonel began barking orders into a radio and the soldiers followed Vera into the city.

***

The rescue efforts went faster and were more fruitful than anyone had dared hope. Added by the telekinetics, rubble and debris were able to be quickly and gently lifted and sifted through. Virtually the entire Sodality was soon present, operating in shifts and relays, swiftly transporting the seriously injured to neighboring towns and cities for medical attention, then just as swiftly transporting back large quantities of food, water, and medicine for the rescuers and survivors. 

With so many telekinetics present and all of them so focused on their task, a well executed suppressor operation during those days might have been able to capture the entire Sodality. The PDP recognized this and made such an attempt. Their aircraft and ground vehicles approached Warsaw from all sides, only to be intercepted and turned back by the conventional Polish army and air force long before reaching the city. After some skirmishes and downed aircraft, the suppressors and their operators retreated. Whether the army did this because of how dependent the rescue operation was on the Sodality or out of a fearful desire to avoid escalation is unclear. This was the last operation by PDP, the HDU, or any of the other such agencies prior to their dissolution the following fall.

In the coming weeks, the United States agreed to Vera Kelly's proposals, with some minor modifications that existed mostly to avoid the appearance of total capitulation. The rest of NATO soon followed, along with most of the rest of the global holdouts, with the exception of a handful of the usual pariahs. To the relief of the international community, the Sodality seemed content to ignore these intransigents. All this was later ratified by the United Nations, formally putting in place the bundle of telekinetic rights and governance systems that is still, nominally at least, in place today.

***

This is the story as it is widely known. But it is not the only story. 

Much later, long after Vera Kelly's death and only shortly before her own tragic and untimely end, Ameera would confess to a close confidant something that they had witnessed that day. While all members of the Sodality had their attention turned towards the conflict, most were at two great of a distance to resolve any meaningful detail. Xinyue was closer, but in dutifully maintaining the perimeter, her focus was split. She perceived most of the primary actions, heard what words were passed between Vera and Ezekiel prior to exchanging blows, but she did not observe every moment.

Ameera did. And while her private account accorded with the story as it has been told in almost every particular, it differed on one small, but critical point. Ameera swore that, just a handful of seconds before Ezekiel's tumbling frame struck concrete, Vera had relinquished her grip and restored Ezekiel's powers. While she did nothing to arrest his fall herself, she did restore to him the ability to save himself. Yet he did not.

Perhaps Ameera was mistaken. Perhaps she just desperately did not wish to believe that her hero could have killed one of her own students, and convinced herself that they saw an act of mercy that did not occur.

Or perhaps Ameera is correct. In which case, what are we to make of this? Did Ezekiel, so distraught by the events of the day and by his own defeat, fail to recognize the restoration of his powers? Or did he, at some point during his struggle with Vera or his long fall, been overcome by remorse for his slaughter of an entire city and choose to accept death as a punishment, however insufficient?

And what about Vera's subsequent actions? It is true that she did not in that speech take active responsibility for slaying Ezekiel. Nor, as far as can be determined, did she do so at any point in the remaining years of her life. But she never defended herself from such accusations either, even as those very accusations tore the Sodality apart and put us on the path to where we are now.

There are many stories that one could tell with Ameera's revelation. Here is one.

***

Ezekiel's strength, his telekinetic strength and his strength of will (which were perhaps related), were always somewhat hampered by his impatience and his dislike of subtlety and nuance. What was right was right, wrong was wrong. In debates over the Sodality's strategy, he had always proposed the most direct approach.

This tendency had only intensified after the Proclamation. The media blitz, the summits, the negotiations were interminable distractions in his eyes.

"The governments of the world aren't look for some agreement. The HDU and their ilk aren't looking to compromise," Ezekiel had argued. "They are just stalling while they look for a way out of this. And here we are, letting them! We're fighting on their terms rather than ours. We have the advantage now and we should be leveraging it. They made a gun that almost killed Vera, for Pete's sake! How long before they made one that will succeed?"

In his mind, Vera's stony bombardment those many years ago and the more recent assault on the HDU headquarters hadn't gone far enough, hadn't been public enough. 

"We can't persuade the HDU. We can only destroy them."

All the peoples and governments of the world could only be persuaded through blunt demonstration. They needed to be presented with undeniable evidence that this was a war that *they could not win*. 

Just what such a demonstration would consist of, Ezekiel had not explained, though it was clear that it would involve a large scale loss of life, and likely not purely military life either. Vera, who usually let such debates run their course, had cut him off here. "The Sodality will not become murderers. *We* will not be come murderers." Their actions to date had been targeted and precise, focused on equipment or rescuing captured novitiates or, only in extremity, in self-defense. "My past homicides were a mistake, not something to be emulated and escalated."

Whether it was due to genuine consensus or simple deference to Vera's status in the community, the debate had ended with Vera's stern, public rebuttal. Ezekial relented and turned his efforts towards supporting the current strategy. But it is doubtful that he abandoned the idea altogether. That was not who he was. He would have turned it over in his mind, refining it, preparing for when circumstances might change, hopefully before all was lost.

And then Carla had been so brutally murdered. 

Ezekiel certainly had not part in this, for he genuinely loved the old woman. And besides, duplicity and betrayal were not in his nature. This was likely the lesson he learned most readily from Vera's mentorship. 

But Carla was dead. 

Now a plan presented itself. His plan. Or a grander version of it. For this needed to be on a grand scale. He would only have this one opportunity. He needed to show all the generals and presidents and dictators exactly how much their mightiest weapons paled in comparison to what his family could do, to what *he* could do. Show them that their only option was capitulation. 

A city block would not do, nor a neighborhood. No, he would level the whole of Warsaw. Let the castles and palaces fall. Let the whole world watch in horror. Let them fear what may come next.

And yet, he had not wholly ignored Vera's arguments, had not completely rejected her political acumen. She was right that this action, this viscous travesty, would damn him in the eyes of the world. If he wasn't careful, they would damn the whole Sodality. They would redouble their efforts to hunt down every novitiate before they became a threat. They would hate him for this. Such hatred was only the natural the response.

So he couldn't be the one that they capitulated too. They would rather die than surrender to him. They needed a different option, a better option, one that they could tell themselves that they made willingly, out of the goodness of their own hearts. That they had chosen to show him just how wrong his violence was. That they had chosen peace for some reason other than fear. Fine then. Let him be hated. Let them choose Vera.

And so he embarked on his mad, unforgivable slaughter.

But maybe all this is to attribute too much premeditation to Ezekiel. Maybe he acted instinctively, out of a blind rage. Maybe only when the sobering reality set in - that he had leveled a city, that the lives of more than a million people, each their own precious universe, had been snuffed out by his hand - did he realize the destination of his path. Maybe he formulated this plan in some desperate attempt to grant his life - and its end - a bare thread of meaning beyond senseless holocaust.

Not that Ezekiel's precious meaning meant one iota to those who died that day. To the parents who died clutching their children to try and protect them from crumbling buildings. To the children who died without their parents, crushed under tons of concrete and steel. To the taxi drivers and their passengers. To the nurses and doctors and patients in each of the more than a dozen hospitals in Warsaw. To the countless individuals who survived, but knew and cared about someone, about so many people who died that day. To the tourists there to witness the centuries of Warsaw's history, that history which was now ended, crushed flat by an invisible, inhuman palm.

Nor would that meaning have mattered to Vera Kelly. She wouldn't have spent more than a moment that day considering why Ezekiel did what he did. Even before his body had finished tumbling down that concrete slope out of her line of sight, she would have moved on to trying to figure out how to salve this horrific situation. 

Ezekiel would have known this. He would have counted on it when he forced Vera to strike him down, when he chose to die rather than save himself in those last few seconds. 

After all, his death was necessary to his plan. Dying, to all appearances, by Vera's hand served two critical purposes in Ezekiel's twisted mind. First, it positioned Vera Kelly as the hero, the savior, not of the Sodality this time, but of Poland, of the entire world. She had promised that she and the Sodality collectively could police telekinetics. Today she would demonstrate both her ability and her decisive willingness to do precisely that. The nations of the world could deal with her in confidence, knowing that this woman, this newcomer to the world of international politics, would indeed uphold her end of the bargain.

Ezekiel's death would also convey another, far darker, message. He had leveled a major city like it was nothing. Soldiers and tanks and aircraft had meant nothing to him. Even the much vaunted suppressors couldn't approach him. He had delivered devastation as complete as any nuclear bomb and done so with far less warning than an ICBM. And yet, Vera Kelly had defeated him, felled him without a scratch, without breaking a sweat. If Ezekiel was capable of such horror, what, then, was Vera Kelly capable of? What would she do to the world on the day that her patience finally ran dry, when her final entreaty for peace fell on deaf ears? The nations of the world would finally realize just how generous were the terms that Vera Kelly was offering.

Vera's crisis-mind would have grasped this almost immediately. Whatever sorrow, regret, or devastation she no doubt felt that day, she would not have hesitated to take the actions dictated by Ezekiel's twin lessons.

But this is only a story. If Ezekiel or Vera ever confided their thoughts on this day to anyone prior to their respective deaths, that confidence remains unbroken.


## Epilogue - A Compression

*Eleven years after the Proclamation*

This may seem like an odd place to end Vera Kelly's story. But the fact is, that along with her reduced ability to listen to others following the destruction of Warsaw, she also ceased confiding in those around her to any meaningful degree. 

Regardless of the truth of what happened that day, the subsequent era of peace lasted all too briefly. Rifts and disagreements, previously restrained by the need for unity in the face of their oppressors, soon split the Sodality. Vera Kelly had always encouraged debate and discussion within the community. Despite her best efforts however, in practice all substantive decisions were those favored, or at least not actively disapproved, by her. Vera Kelly's slaying of Ezekiel broke those bounds of trust and deference. For all of the immensity of his crime, Ezekiel had been one of them and Vera had not hesitated in killing him. She did so unilaterally, without consulting the Sodality. Furthermore, she did accomplished the act by withholding his powers, something that she had never taught any of them to do, something they hadn't even realized was possible for one of them to do. 

A certain fear fell over the telekinetics in those days, one that was exacerbated when countries violated the spirit of the TK Laws, as they came to be known. These violations came in countless small ways, most often as a mere laggardness in enforcing violations of the laws against their citizenry. Furthermore, some new novitiates, no longer driven out of house and home by the regional HDU equivalent, chose to stay with their families. As a result, they retained their loyalties to family and nation, rather than developing close bonds with the Sodality. Often they were reluctant to abide by the TK Laws at all, not fully understanding just how much was spent to build them and what good they meant.

Through all of this, Vera Kelly sought to maintain and enforce the laws she had fought so hard for. She did this even if it meant turning over a deviant telekinetic to the local authorities to be imprisoned in a suppressor-equipped prison. Even if it meant overlooking the more mundane domestic and international injustices that were within the Sodality's power to prevent.

Before long, the more radical members of the Sodality began speaking of Ezekiel as a martyr rather than as a monster. They advocated for more aggressive actions to not only secure their rights, but to combat other evils in the world. Such advocacy soon escalated into first covert actions and then ostentatious ones. When the nations of the world demanded action, Vera Kelly promised that she would bring this breakaway sect to justice. That declaration would come to be known as the start of the Telekinetic Civil War. Though it waxed and waned, it would not end soon, and Vera Kelly would spend the rest of her life struggling to end that war, a war that came to consume the entire world.

In the lead up to the Telekinetic Civil War, some precious few members of the Sodality declined to take up arms against their own or against anyone at all. Lucas Hayward, who, despite his reverence for Vera Kelly, couldn't bring himself to impose upon another the imprisonment he had endured for so long. Aubrey Torres, who having lost her family in a civil war, refused to inflict that suffering on anyone else, no matter how just the cause. And Arsène Laurent, myself, who simply believed that the strength of violence was no strength at all. 

I ceased to know Vera Kelly after our split. In fact, I had ceased to know her for some time before then. Ezekiel's death or his cruelty or some combination of the two had broken something in her. No longer did she quietly and intently listen to even the most abrasive members of the Sodality. She began to ignore advice from all but a trusted few. Dissent was either ignored or crushed.  Perhaps just as the Sodality had come to fear her, she had come to fear those she had raised. For this reason, what she thought and endured in those subsequent years, in the brutality and division that characterized the period before her death, I shall not speculate.

When I approached her in the study at Emancipación to tell her that I was leaving the Sodality, she did not attempt to persuade me to remain. She did make such an attempt with Lucas and Aubrey. While she was not successful with them, she did succeed with a few others who contemplated departing then and later.

With me, she listened quietly, intently, as I explained my motivations and where I believed she had erred, how she could still correct her course. She offered no counterargument, no defense of her conduct. She simply listened. Gone was the Vera Kelly of recent years, whose paranoia forestalled even minor critique. Here was the Vera Kelly who had raised me and the rest of the Sodality. Who always took even our most inane ramblings, our slightest whimsy, as seriously as the wisdom of a sage. I do not believe that I have ever been so heard by another person in my life, before or since. Those without our powers will never know what it is like to speak and to be heard not only by voice and by ear, but with something closer to the direct communion of our intertwined awareness. 

When at last I finished my meandering piece, her awareness disengaged from mine. She sat silently for a while. I waited. Finally, she stood and spoke, "I will pray wholeheartedly for your success, Arsène. Before you go, may we embrace as friends?" I stepped forward and wrapped my arms and my mind about her. We embraced not though perhaps not as friends but as family. I know not how long we stood like that. I do know it was I who broke away at last, tears in my eyes as I fled the room.

***

There is one last part of Vera Kelly's story that I would like to tell.

I never spoke with Vera Kelly again after my departure, not in person and not by any other means, though we were occasionally in the same city and though I remained in contact with some friends on both sides of the conflict. It was thus a great surprise to me when, years later, shortly after Vera Kelly's death, Xinyue showed up on my doorstep.

As we stood in my small garden, it saddened me to see how those few years of strife had aged her. For all our time building the Sodality and fighting against the HDU, Xinyue had seemed beyond the ravages of time. Her long, black hair had remained as dark as the night sky over Emancipación. Her skin smooth despite our hard, largely outdoor life. Now, streaks of grey broke the black expanse of her hair. Small wrinkles were visible at the corners of her yes. More importantly, her quiet confidence and rare flashes of wry humor were replaced by an exhausted resolution. It was evident in her face and in her bearing. She had taken up the mantle of leadership of the Sodality and it did not rest lightly upon her shoulders.

Xinyue knelt to examine the cucumbers growing in the plot that I had just been weeding. She ran her hand over their smooth exteriors. Then she looked over my dirt-covered gloves, my sweat-laden brow.

"Why pick the weeds by hand? You could have them all out with but a though, root and stem?" She asked me, not condescendingly but genuinely curious, with a hint of concern. Was she worried that I was rejecting my powers? Turning my back on our shared past?

"Why do you kneel to touch these plants when you could have remained standing?" I replied.

The barest flicker of a relieved smile danced across her face. 

"It does me good to see that all this time, after all that has happened, you follow her teachings still. I can remember it clearly, her telling us for the thousandth time about the importance of a life outside of our powers and a home away from the struggle." She trailed off for a moment, her fingers continuing to trace a slow across the leaves. "I regret how little time I am able to spend at Emancipación."

"Vera made many mistakes. One of them was not always following her own advice. You would do well to heed that lesson." I stood, brushed off the dirt from my hands on my overalls, and waited for Xinyue to explain her presence. 

She remained kneeling but looking up to study my face with both her eyes and her mind, as if seeking the answer to some question. I offered no resistance. I spoke only truth to all the telekinetics who came to visit me, no matter their purpose. Another lesson I learned from Vera. The primacy of honesty. I had nothing to hide from Xinyue. On the contrary, I desperately wanted her to hear what I had been saying ever since my departure.

Finally she spoke. "Vera specified precious little in her will, you know. Our lives were subject to too much change and she had few belongings that did not belong to the Sodality collectively. She left most decisions up to us." *To me*, her tone implied with just a hint of bitterness. 

*Good,* I thought to myself, *Your position should be a burden, not a privilege.*

Xinyue continued, "Among her few requests was for you to speak at her funeral." Her expression provided no elaboration on that sentence, likely because she had none to provide. There was the question that she had been asking with her eyes. She wanted to know why Arsène, why this one who had left. 

My confused silence provided her answer. She sighed with more than a little disappointment.

"It is this Saturday. 11am. At Emancipación, of course. Will you speak?"

For a moment, I continued to stare mutely, turning over this request in my mind. I looked up at the leaves of the tree in whose shade we sheltered. My awareness flowed out, over the plants of my garden and up the tree, feeling every detail of its familiar shape, its slight sway in the gentle breeze, each individual leaf fluttering in the midday sun. *Why must we who are capable of perceiving such beauty inflict so much pain on this world?*

Xinyue waited patiently for me to return to myself.

"I will."

***

The funeral took place on a bright September day. I had always wondered if Vera Kelly had chosen this spot for its similarity to her birthplace. Never had those similarities appeared more evident to me. The smell of the high desert. The clarity of the skin. The abrasiveness of sand and dust and mesquite and thorn. The earthen colors of adobe and wood.

The buildings were much the same as when I had last been here, but an air of disuse permeated the place. Gardens were clearly untended, fences unmended. No horses remained. It was painful to see. I was not the only one so affected. Tears flowed freely among the older members of the Sodality, some of whom had not returned to Emancipación in years. So too did tears flow at the sight of the bell tower, which now sparkled on all sides. 

It was there, before the tower, that I found Ameera. We embraced and then, still clasping my arms, she looked me in the eyes. Those green eyes of hers had lost none of their power to penetrate the soul.

"Hello, brother." She spoke out loud in French and I responded similarly.

"Hello, sister."

"Tell me, do you believe that this cycle of violence will ever end?"

To anyone else, including myself, I would have professed optimism. Trapped in those eyes, I was surprised to hear my own response. "I don't know. I think it unlikely."

"And yet you haven't lost hope. You haven't given up."

"No."

"Why?"

"Because a young girl, hunted and scared, survived for months in the mountains without sleep. Because she grew up and changed the world. The odds are slim. That doesn't mean it isn't worth trying."

Ameera nodded. "We will speak again after. With her passing, I must follow a new path." She turned and walked away, leaving me in the shadow of the bell tower.

***

To my surprise, Antonio and Flora were present too, two senior members of the radical faction that had been fighting against the Sodality these past years. *Did the others decline to attend or are they really the only surviving members who were raised here?*  Despite the carnage wrought by the group, the thought saddened me, as did the realization that I had lost track of who was still alive and who had died. The Sodality raised no alarm at their presence however, no call to arms, leading me to believe that some truce must have been called for this event. *Good. May this truce never end.* The fact that  Emancipación still stood was itself the product of an informal, unspoken truce, with neither side wanting to destroy their refuge, a symbol of some shared values. I chose to take some measure of hope from that fact.

The truce did not extend to friendliness however. Antonio and Flora kept to themselves in the hours leading up to the ceremony and departed swiftly after its conclusion.

***

At 11am, we made our way from the bittersweet tours to the stony amphitheater. We moved individually and in small groups, discussion happening in hushed tones. Our awarenesses brushed against each other gingerly, as if we were all delicate and fragile. Maybe we were.

Vera Kelly's body lay on the ground at the front of the amphitheater, tightly wrapped in a white shroud. She seemed so much smaller in death than she had in life. Her awareness, her presence had always stretched so far beyond mere muscle and sinew. But all that was gone now.

Some fifty of us were spread across the seats. Our awarenesses met more solidly as we caressed the body of our fallen savior. More than one person broke into audible sobs.

After some time, Xinyue strode down the dirt steps to the stage. She walked around to the far side of the corpse and turned to face the audience. She wore all black, in sharp contrast to the white shroud at her feet. Her well tailored vest and pants initially seemed to be plain, but a closer inspection found that they were covered in an intricate embroidered pattern of black thread. Her graying hair was pulled up into a tight bun.

"I thank you all for coming, in particular our estranged siblings." She nodded at Antonio and Flora, sitting on their own at the edge of the theater. "There will only be one speaker today. All other commemoration shall take place privately, afterwards." Surprise fluttered across the network of our awarenesses and several people physical turned to took around. None was more astonished than I. While there was no printed program, I had imagined a long series of speeches, maybe even some songs. When Xinyue had said Vera had specifically requested my participation, she hadn't mentioned that Vera had requested that *only* I speak.

"I welcome Arsène Laurent to speak." The eyes turned to me, their surprise only intensifying at the pronouncement.

Shaking off my own surprise, I rose and approached the stage. As I did Xinyue walked off and sat down in the first row. She neatly folded her hands in her lap and watched me closely, intently curious at what final game Vera Kelly was playing here. I looked down at the shrouded body before me. *Did Vera Kelly know what I would say? She was not one for sentimentality. I am here to serve some purpose. What is it?* I looked out at the expectant crowd, answerless. *Well there's nothing for it now but honesty.*

I cleared my throat and began to speak.

"You are all wondering why I am here. I've been wondering the same thing these past few days. Or at least in the spare moments that I am not struggling to imagine a world without Vera Kelly. We all live today because of her. And now we shall have to find a way to live without her.

"You may begrudge my presence here. That is fair. I haven't spoken with most of you for almost eight years now. Those of you whom I have spoken with have called me naïve. Idealistic. Childish. You called me these things for refusing to take up arms. For instead "merely" protecting bystanders from your excesses, cleaning up your messes, and pleading with you to choose another path." A grumble of discontent swept through the crowd. I ignored it.

"But Vera Kelly never called me naïve. The last time we spoke, she said that she would pray for my success. Then, a few days ago, she invited me here today. Evidently she thought I had something to say to you." *That or this is her idea of a joke. Perhaps both.*

"You may not respect me, but you certainly respected her. How could you not? She was a damn sight better than we could ever have hoped for. Most people, including all of us here, would have either failed far sooner or simply would have never tried. Do not for a moment think that you could have escaped like she did. But Vera Kelly did escape. She found freedom in the wilderness. But she didn't stay there. She could have walked away and instead she turned back. For us.

"But now she has departed us for good and we have gathered here to commemorate her, commemorate Vera Kelly. It seems impossible that a simple name like Vera Kelly could have encapsulated all she was. Perhaps that is why she had so many, despite her intractable and infuriating avoidance of aliases." This elicited a small laugh from the crowd. "The world knows her as the Old Woman, the Ur-Witch, the Good Cop, and so many others. And though we had our own joke epithets for her, when it came down to it, we always knew her as simply Vera."

The assembled telekinetics nodded in agreement.

"Except that's not quite right. We had other, unspoken names for her, roles that we wanted - *needed* - her to play. For some of us it was the revolutionary general, who would burn the world down and build a more perfect one upon the ashes. For some of us, it was the stateswoman, the diplomat extraordinaire, who would carve out a space for us in this world with political stratagems and realpolitik. She was both of these, of course, at times. And at others, she was neither.  

"I didn't want her to be either. I wanted her to be something that I don't think she ever was: a saint, someone who both rejected violence and refused to participate in the injustices of our world. I recognize now that this was unfair. Saints are maladapted for this world. The role of the saint isn't to succeed, at least not by the standards of society, but to show us what is possible, to point the way for future generations, and perhaps to die in the attempt. Vera Kelly was never maladapted. She sought to succeed in her lifetime. Deep down, she thought she couldn't be both virtuous and effective and so she was willing to sacrifice the former for the latter. Despite her qualms, when it came down to it, she was always willing to bite and claw and even kill to achieve her aims, to forge a place in the world for us.

"But if I was unfair to her, so to were all of of you. We all wanted her to have all the answers all the time. Any hint of fallibility, any deviation from our image of perfection, either had to be ignored or treated as a betrayal. But she wasn't some ideal archetype. No one can be, particularly not when you live as long as her. For all of her talent and intelligence, she was as human as you or I: more scarred than most of us, more used to having to fend for herself. She knew loneliness in a way that none of us have.

"Despite her fallibility and her imperfections though, she made an attempt. She sought to change this world for the better. And it was a damn good attempt. She made it far further than any of us would have, as I said before. I want us to remember that.

"I also want us to remember that she failed, that the world has not been saved, that we have not secured peace nor is there any in sight, that we are perhaps more divided than ever. Her one success is here, is us. She saved us and raised us and gave us a chance, a chance to make an attempt of our own, a chance to succeed where she failed. That is why I am here today: to ask you to make an attempt. Not using her methods, which have led us nowhere. Nor using the methods of violence and terror that have only begot more violence and terror. I am here today to ask you to become what she could not: saints.

"I know this is unfair. This would be easier if she had shown us the way, if she had demonstrated for us - for the world - that this was possible, if she who had led us so far could have led us just a bit further. Instead you will have to take my word that this is possible. You will have to trust that she invited me here for a reason, that in the end she recognized her insufficiency and aspired for more from us.

"Even if you do listen to me, I cannot promise success. The world may not be ready for peace. It may never be. But I can promise you that if we persist on the path we are on, we will fail. Our betrayals and infighting and distrust and petty hates will undo us. We will kill all our foes and find ever new ones. We will forge a desolation and call it peace. We will live in fear that those whom we oppress will one day seek their revenge. I'm not offering you salvation. I'm not offering you certainty. I'm offering you a chance. 
 
"I am not here to remember our savoir. I am not here to remember what Vera Kelly accomplished. I am here to remember the woman who made an attempt. And to remind you all that we still can too."

With that I stepped down from the stage and strode back to my seat. No one met my eye, not with challenge or gratitude. Did I change anyone's mind that day? Did I save any souls? I doubted it. I had said much the same thing for years. If my words had fallen on deaf ears then, why would they be heard now? Vera Kelly could have made herself heard, I knew. But Vera Kelly was dead and I was no Vera Kelly. 

Xinyue retook the stage. To my great surprise, she looked directly at me, sought out my gaze. "Thank you, Arsène." She meant it too, I could tell. Perhaps Vera Kelly had been right to entrust me with this duty. Perhaps I could still make a difference.

Then Xinyue turned towards the audience at large, she raised her arms before her. We rose to our feet and our arms matched hers.

"Let us begin," Xinyue said, loudly and clearly.

We turned out wills upon Vera Kelly's form. We lifted her body into the air. It was effortless together, her body like a feather. Xinyue looked over the assembled telekinetics, her friends and her foes, tears streaming down her pale face. "Let us remember the fallen." She called, her voice impressively firm through the tears.

"Let us remember our sibling," we responded in unison. I had said these words only once before, but other members of the Sodality had said them far too many times for the age of our community.

"Let her memory be a star to light our way forward," Xinyue called proudly, defiantly.

"Let her memory be a beacon to lead us home," we responded.

And then we began. Our combined will began compressing Vera Kelly's body. Carefully, evenly, but with great force. First we crushed her limbs into her chest and then folded her ribes in, forming her chest into a ball. We pressed harder than any industrial vice. Flesh and blood and bone collapsed before us into a dense sphere. Any onlooker would have found the sight horrifying, repulsive, but to us it was communion. 

As we increased our pressure, the remains began heating. We kept pressing. Harder. Harder.  The compressed matter began to glow with the heat of massive pressure. Molecules broke down into elements. Elements separated out by density. We allowed the hydrogen and oxygen to escape in the form of gas and plasma. Then the nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, iron, and all the other trace elements. Soon only carbon remained. The light grew brighter as the rough sphere shrank under our combined force, it's diameter decreasing from 2 feet to 1 feet to eight inches, becoming a more and more perfect sphere as it did so. Soon it shone like a star, brilliant and painful to behold. 

Coordinating through touch without any directions, we transitioned from our smooth, evenly distributed pressure, to the formation of faces and facets. We shaped and molded it, not perfectly, but not far off from it either. Then we just held it in place. Minutes passed, then hours. The sun progressed in its course across the desert sky. We did not move, we did not waver. Gradually, imperceptibly, the light dimmed. As our eyes cleared, we saw the large, sparkling diamond floating before us.

With a sense of productive exhaustion, we released our all consuming embrace of the gem. Only Xinyue kept a hold on it, kept it floating, spinning and sparkling in the light of the sunset. She then propelled the immense jewel up over our heads to the bell tower. There it came to rest, tightly fitted into a sconce alongside a dozen others. 

And that, is the end of the story of Vera Kelly. I choose to believe that it is not the end of our story.
